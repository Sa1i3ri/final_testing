* Currently, the images/thumbnails inside the Storefront are not making use of any lazy loading mechanism. 
* Without a third-party extension which includes something like ""lazysizes"" it is not possible to get lazy loading images.
* Native lazy loading of images is available in current browsers, see: https://caniuse.com/?search=loading","## Decision

We will implement native lazy loading for images and thumbnails in the Storefront by adding the `loading=""lazy""` attribute to all relevant `<img>` elements. This approach leverages built-in browser support for lazy loading, eliminating the need for third-party libraries or extensions like ""lazysizes."" This simplifies the implementation, reduces dependencies, and improves page load performance by deferring image loading until they are near the viewport. To maintain compatibility, we will ensure graceful fallback behavior for browsers that do not support native lazy loading.","## Decision

* We want to make use of native lazy loading for images in the Storefront without adding additional JavaScript logic."
"## Context

When using the `OneToOneAssociationField` & `ManyToOneAssociationField` associations it is possible to specify the parameter `autoload` as `true`. This causes the association to be loaded with every query, regardless of whether the data is used or not.

This is a performance issue due to unnecessary data transfer, it slows down SQL queries with extra joins, slows the application down with hydrating and data processing and finally, API payloads are larger than they need to be.","## Decision

To improve performance and minimize unnecessary data loading, the use of the `autoload` parameter in `OneToOneAssociationField` and `ManyToOneAssociationField` associations will be deprecated and discouraged. Instead, associations will be loaded explicitly only when needed through targeted query criteria or eager loading mechanisms controlled at the query level.

Developers should avoid setting `autoload: true` by default and instead leverage explicit association loading strategies such as:

- Using query builder methods to fetch associations only when required.
- Implementing lazy loading patterns where data is retrieved on demand.
- Applying API design principles to request only necessary related entities in each use case.

This approach will reduce SQL query complexity, minimize data transfer and hydration overhead, and result in smaller, more efficient API payloads. The system’s documentation will be updated to reflect best practices for explicit association loading and warn about the performance pitfalls of always autoloading associations.","## Decision

We will deprecate the usage of autoload === true in the core codebase in version 6.5. All usages in entity definitions should be removed by the time 6.6 is released.

We have introduced a new PHPStan rule which will check for any usages of autoload === true and fail if it finds any. The failures are currently ignored in the `phpstan.neon.dist` file until they can be fixed by the respective teams."

Currently, our ADRs are grouped into folders according to different areas. We have added this structure to help people find their way around when they are looking for specific ADRs.

However, there are different approaches when searching for ADRs:
1) I am looking for an ADR and I know the headline.
2) I would like to read the latest ADRs
3) I would like to see ADRs for a specific area.
4) ...

The structuring by areas is good for case 3, but not for the other two. In the first case, the user can easily use the search via the directory to use the appropriate ADR, but will also get duplicate matches. Depending on the keyword the result can be quite long.

In the second case, I would like to read the latest ADRs, the user would have to go to git history, which is only possible via shell or IDE.","## Decision

To better support different ADR discovery scenarios, we will adopt a multi-faceted ADR organization and access strategy:

- Maintain the existing folder structure by area to allow users to browse ADRs related to specific domains or topics (case 3).

- Introduce a centralized index or table of contents (TOC) file at the root level of the ADR repository that lists all ADRs in chronological order, with titles, dates, and area tags. This allows users to quickly access the latest ADRs without relying on git history (case 2).

- Enhance the ADR file metadata to include consistent titles and keywords, enabling effective searching within the repository using search tools, reducing duplicate or noisy matches (case 1).

- Consider tagging or adding metadata inside each ADR (e.g., front matter with area, date, keywords) to facilitate automated generation of indexes, filters, and search.

By combining hierarchical organization for browsing by area with centralized indexes and improved metadata, we enable users to efficiently find ADRs by headline, latest decisions, or area. This approach balances structure and discoverability without duplicating ADR documents.","## Decision

We will remove the area structure on directory level and introduce front matter in our ADRs as we already do in our changelog files. This makes it possible to extract metadata from content. Additionally, it can be used as groundwork, if we want to release our ADRs in different front-ends (handbook, dev-docs) and use the front-end's search functionalities.
With front matter and the flat file structure, you can solve all three problems described in this ADR. An example of this specific ADR would be:

```markdown
---
title: Unstructured ADRs
date: 2023-02-23
area: Product Operation #I added prod-ops because this is a workflow topic
tags: [ADR, file structure, workflow]
---
```

We also hope that this will make it easier for people to submit ADRs without being confused about which folder to put the file in."
"## Context
Our current plugin extension system for the administration is based on our Component Factory. This factory generates native Vue components at runtime based on a base Shopware component which can be extended or overwritten by plugins. This approach offers flexibility to plugin developers to modify every component. For the template part, we use Twig.JS and compile the Vue template in the client at runtime.

However, this approach has its drawbacks. We cannot use the full power of Vue and its ecosystem because everything related to Vue is wrapped with our factories and generated at runtime. We cannot use Vue tools without custom modifications, like linting template files, providing good static analysis, and more. The other downside is that upgrading Vue is challenging, and the performance suffers because we cannot precompile components.

To address these issues, we aimed to test a new idea with Vue 3, which includes all the features of the existing plugin approach, but developed using only native Vue tools. This would offer several benefits, like using the full power of Vue, better performance, better static analysis, and more.

Our main idea for the template part was to use native Vue components named sw-block that can replace the Twig.JS template part. Plugin developers can extend or overwrite the sw-block component as needed.

```html
<sw-block name=""sw-hello-world"">
<div>Hello World</div>
</sw-block>
```

For the script and logic part, we aimed to use the Composition API. Before returning all the component data and methods, we would provide a hook point for plugins so they could modify or inject everything they want.

```js
// The original component
<script setup lang=""ts"">
// Hook for providing extensibility
useExtensibility();
</script>

// The plugin component
<script lang=""ts"">
    import SwOrignal from './sw-original.vue';
    // use our extensibility helpers
    import { useComponentExtender, getPropsFromComponent } from 'sw-vue-extensbiles';
    
    const myCustomData = ref('test');
    
    export default {
        name: 'sw-extended-component',
        props: {
            ...getPropsFromComponent(SwOrignal)
        },
        setup(props, context) {
            return {
                ...useComponentExtender(SwOrignal, props, context),
                myCustomData
            }   
        }
}
</script>
```

However, during the evaluation and testing, we realized that this approach was not feasible due to several reasons. The most critical challenges were that it was hard to merge data because the Vue compiler optimizes many parts of the component, and it was not easy to pass all the data of the component to the block system to give plugin developers full access to the original component's data.

To solve these problems, we would need to use internal Vue logic, which is not update-safe and could break with every Vue update.","## Decision

We will not adopt the proposed native Vue 3 component extension approach with sw-block and the Composition API hooks for extending plugin components.

Instead, we will continue using the existing Component Factory and Twig.JS runtime template compilation system for plugin extensibility in the administration. Despite its drawbacks regarding performance, static analysis, and tooling support, this approach provides a stable, proven, and update-safe mechanism that allows flexible component extension and overwriting by plugins.

The attempted native Vue extensibility approach was rejected because the technical challenges in merging reactive component data and exposing internal component state to plugin blocks cannot be solved without relying on fragile and internal Vue APIs, which risks breaking changes and maintenance overhead on Vue upgrades.

We will periodically revisit the idea of improving the plugin component extension mechanism as the Vue ecosystem evolves, but until then, maintaining the current system ensures backward compatibility and predictable plugin extensibility behavior.","## Decision
After considering the challenges we faced with the proposed solution, we concluded that we couldn't find solutions without using internal Vue logic. Given this situation, we did not see any significant benefits to adopting a native Vue solution over our current plugin system, which, despite its challenges, has proven to work well for our use case.

Therefore, we decided to stick with our current plugin system for the administration until new possibilities arise in Vue that solve our problems."
"## Context
The current workflow for writing technical changelog is not very suited for a trunk based development and branching process. There are some major issues with the current workflow of using one file with a fixed version number:

*  Unnecessary merge conflicts in the changelog file
*  Uncertainty about the correct release version of the change
*  Differences between the issue state in Jira and the code state

To tackle these issues the technique for writing technical changelog and upgrade information, should be changed to a single solution, which is easy to understand and maintain by developers.","## Decision

To address the challenges in the current changelog workflow, we will adopt a decentralized, automated changelog generation approach that aligns with trunk-based development and branching.

Specifically, each developer will document changelog entries in dedicated, per-branch or per-issue files or commit metadata during development. These entries will be merged automatically by the CI/CD pipeline into a consolidated changelog during the release process, referencing the correct version number dynamically assigned at release time.

Additionally, integration with Jira will be enhanced to automatically correlate issue states with changelog entries, ensuring alignment between issue tracking and code changes.

This approach will reduce merge conflicts, remove ambiguity around release versions, and improve traceability between issues and code changes, resulting in a streamlined, maintainable, and developer-friendly changelog process.","## Decision
The changelog and upgrade files for a release should be autogenerated in the build process of the release. Developers should write technical changelog and upgrade information in separate markdown files."

The actions in Flow Builder are listening for Business Events. We want to implement the flow DelayAction in Flow Builder,
that means the actions can be delayed, and will be executed after  a set amount of time.
But we have some problems after the action was delayed:
* Events may contain old data, that data may be updated during the delay, and currently we don't have any way to restore
    the data.
* After a delay the rules have to be re-evaluated, but the data in the rules could be outdated or changed, so the rules
    have to be reloaded as well. Or the rules do not exist anymore.","## Decision

We will implement the DelayAction in Flow Builder by decoupling event data storage and rule evaluation from the initial event reception. Specifically:

- Upon receiving the original event, we will persist a snapshot of the relevant event data along with necessary context into durable storage to capture the exact state at the time of the event.

- The DelayAction will schedule a deferred task to trigger after the specified delay interval.

- When the delay expires, instead of reusing the original event data directly, the system will reload the latest version of the relevant rules from the current rule repository to ensure up-to-date rule evaluation.

- The persisted snapshot data will be combined with the freshly loaded rules and the current system state to re-evaluate conditions accurately, accounting for any changes in data or rule definitions that occurred during the delay period.

- If the rules or referenced data no longer exist at execution time, the system will detect this during re-evaluation and handle it gracefully by skipping or aborting the delayed action with appropriate logging and notifications.

This approach ensures consistency by preserving the original event context while enabling fresh rule evaluation at execution time, accommodating any changes that occurred during the delay and preventing stale or invalid executions.","## Decision

We would need to detach the Event System and the Flow System from each other, thus removing the dependency on the runtime objects within an event.
Meaning the Actions must not have access to the original Events.

We would create a class `StorableFlow`, that can store the data in the original event as scalar values, and restore the original data based on this stored data.
```php
class StorableFlow
{
    // contains the scalar values based on the original events
    // $store can be serialized and used to restore the object data
    protected array $store = [];
    
    // contains the restored object data like the data we defined in the `availableData` in original events 
    // $data can not be serialized, but can be restored from $store
    protected array $data = [];
      
    public function __construct(array $store = [], array $data = [])
    {
        $this->store = $store;
        $this->data = $data;
    }
    
    // This method will be called in each `Storer` to store the representation of data
    public function setStore(string $key, $value) {
        $this->store[$key] = $value;
    }
    
    public function getStore(string $key) {
        return $this->store[$key];
    }
    
    // After we restored the data in `Storer`, we can set the data, we'll use `$this->data` instead getter data on original event
    public function setData(string $key, $value) {
        $this->data[$key] = $value;
    }
    
    public function getData(string $key) {
        return $this->data[$key];
    }
}
```

The `StorableFlow` class will be use on Flow Builder:

Before:

```php
class FlowDispatcher 
{
    public function dispatch(Event $event) {
        ...
        // Currently, dispatch on Flow Builder use the original event to execute the Flow 
        $this->callFlowExecutor($event);
        ...
    }
}
```

After:

```php
class FlowDispatcher 
{
    public function dispatch(Event $event) {
        ...
        // The `FlowFactory` will create/restore the `StorableFlow` from original event
        $flow = $this->flowFactory->create($event);
        // use the `StorableFlow` to execute the flow builder actions instead of the original events
        $this->execute($flow);
        ...
    }
}
```

* Flow Builder actions may no longer access the original event.
* Each Aware Interface gets its own `Storer` class to restore the data of Aware, so we have many `Storer` like `OrderStorer`, `MailStorer`, `CustomerStorer` ...
* The main task of a `Storer` is to restore the data from a scalar storage.
* The `Storer` provides a store function, in order to store itself the data, in order restore the object
* The `Storer` provides a restore function to restore the object using the store data.

```php
interface FlowStorer {}
```
Example for `OrderStorer`:

```php
class OrderStorer implements FlowStorer
{
    // This function to check the original event is the instanceof Aware interface, and store the representation.
    public function store(FlowEventAware $event, array $storedData): array 
    {
        if ($event instanceof OrderAware) {
            $storedData['orderId'] = $event->getOrderId();
        }
        
        return $storedData;
    }
    
    // This function is restore the data based on representation in `storedData`
    public function restore(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {
        if ($flow->hasStore('orderId')) {
            // allows to provide a closure for lazy data loading
            // this opens the opportunity to have lazy loading for big data
            // When we load the entity, we need to add the necessary associations for each entity
            $flow->lazy('order', [$this, 'load']);    
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

About the additional data defined in `availableData` in original events, that aren't defined in any Aware Interfaces and we can't restore that data in the `Storer`.
To cover the additional data from original events, we will have another `store` `AdditionalStorer` to store those data.
```php
class AdditionalStorer extends FlowStorer
{
    public function store(FlowEventAware $event, array $storedData)
    {
        ...
        // based on the `getAvailableData` in the original event to get the type of additional data
        $additionalDataTypes = $event::getAvailableData()->toArray();
        
        foreach ($additionalDataTypes as $key => $eventData) {
            // Check if the type of data is Entity or EntityCollection
            // in the $storedData, we only store the presentation like ['id' => id, 'entity' => entity], we'll restore the data in `AdditionalStorer::restore`
            if ($eventData['type'] === 'Entity' || 'EntityCollection') {
                $storedData[$key] = [
                    'id' => $event->getId(),
                    'entity' => Entity                 
                ];
            }
            
            // Check if the type of data is ScalarValueType
            if ($eventData['type'] === ScalarValueType) {
                $storedData[$key] = value
            }
            
            // start to implement /Serializable for ObjectType
            if ($eventData['type'] === ObjectType) {
                $storedData[$key] = value->serialize()
            }
            
            ...
        }
        
        ... 
        
        return $storedData;
    }
      
    // this function  make sure we can restore the additional data from original data are not covered in `Storer`
    // The additional data can be other entity, because the entities we defined in Aware interface like `order`, `customer` ... covered be `Storer`
    public function restore(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {
        if (type === entity) {
            // About the associations for entity data, mostly the additional entity data is the base entity, we don't need to add associations for this
            $flow->setData($key, $this->load());
        } else {
            $flow->setData($key, $flow->getStore($key));
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

About the associations for entity data, mostly the additional entity data is the base entity, we don't need to add associations for this.
About the `ObjectType` data, we enforce all values used in ObjectType implement /Serializable, and serialize the object before store to `$storedData`.

* Flow Builder actions only work with the `StorableFlow` instead of the `FlowEvent`. The `StorableFlow` will restore the data from original events via `Storer`,
  and the Actions can get the data via `getData($key)` from `StorableFlow` instead of `getAvailableData` from original events.

Before, in the flow actions still dependency Aware interfaces:

```php
    public function handle(StorableFlow $event) {
        ...
        $baseEvent = $event->getEvent();
    
        if ($baseEvent instanceof CustomerAware) {
            $customerId= $baseEvent->getCustomerId();
        }
        ...
    }
```
After in the flow actions:
```php
    public function handle(StorableFlow $event) {
        ...
        if ($event->hasStore('customerId') {
            $customerId= $event->getStore('customerId');
        }
        ...
    }
```

* `getAvailableData` must NOT be responsible for the access of the data.
* To create new or restore the `StorableFlow` by on the existing stored data, we need to provider the `FlowFactory`.
```php
class FlowFactory
{    
    ...
    public function create(FlowEventAware $event)
    {
        $storedData = [];
        foreach ($this->storer as $storer) {
            // Storer are responsible to move the corresponding 
            // data from the original event 
            $storer->store($event, $storedData);
        }
        
        return $this->restore($storedData);
    }
  
    public function restore(array $stored = [], array $data = [])
    {
        $flow = new StorableFlow($stored, $data);
      
        foreach ($this->storer as $storer) {
            $storer->restore($flow);
        }
  
        return $flow;
    }
    ...
}
```
But when executing a delayed actions, we won't have a `StorableFlow`, we just have the `$stored` from the previously stored `StorableFlow`,
and based on the `$stored`, we can restore a new `StorableFlow`.

Example in Delay Actions:

```php
// In handler delay actions -> put the actions to `queue`
$stored = json_encode($flow->stored());

$connection->executeStatement('INSERT INTO `swag_delay_action` (store) VALUES (:stored)...', ['stored' => $stored]);
```

```php
// In handler execute delay actions
$stored = 'SELECT store FROM `swag_delay_action` .... ';

$flow = $this->flowFactory->restore(json_decode($stored));
```"
"## Context

We need a different extension mechanism besides the well known plugins, that works in cloud and on-prem environments in the same way.
That's why we envisioned the app system, currently publicly available as a [plugin](https://github.com/shopware/app-system).
We were able to quickly develop the app system, gather feedback and iterate over ideas without being bound to the strict release workflow of the shopware platform.
That was the reason why we started working on the app system as a plugin in the first place.

Now as the app system matured, it is time to integrate the app system back into the platform.
This has the following benefits:
* It sends the signal to partners and potential app manufacturers that the app system is stable
* Partners / app manufacturers can rely on the shopware 6 release cycle and the according upgrade process
* Users don't need to install an extra plugin in order to use apps","## Decision

We will integrate the app system directly into the Shopware 6 platform as a first-class extension mechanism, replacing the current approach of delivering it as an external plugin.

This integration will ensure that the app system benefits from the platform’s release and upgrade process, improving stability and user experience by eliminating the need for separate installation steps.

By doing so, we send a clear signal to partners and app manufacturers that the app system is stable and officially supported, encouraging adoption and investment in the extension ecosystem.

The app system will be designed to function uniformly in both cloud and on-premises environments, providing a consistent experience across deployment models.","## Decision

We will migrate the existing app system from the [plugin](https://github.com/shopware/app-system) into the platform. The app system will be part of the core bundle, analogous to the plugin system.
It will be moved to the `Shopware\Core\Framework\App` namespace."
"## Context
At the moment we have a bunch of different `FlowStorer` implementations. Most of them are used to store scalar values without any restore logic. Each of the Storer class has an own interface which is used to identify if the data of the event should be stored. This leads to much boilerplate code when adding new storer implementations or when plugins want to bypass some for events.","## Decision

We will refactor the storage mechanism by introducing a unified `FlowStorer` interface with a common method signature that supports both storing and restoring data. Instead of having multiple distinct interfaces to identify storing behavior, we will use a flexible registration system with metadata or annotations that specify the conditions under which each storer should act on an event. This approach will:

- Reduce boilerplate by consolidating storage logic into implementations of a single interface.
- Enable easy extension for new storer implementations without creating new interfaces.
- Allow plugins to bypass or customize storing behavior by adjusting registration parameters or using decorator patterns.
- Facilitate centralized control over when and how data is stored or restored.

We will incrementally migrate existing storers to the new unified interface to minimize disruption.","## Decision

We introduce a generic `ScalarValuesAware` interface which can be used to store simple values which should be simply stored and restored one to one:

```php
interface ScalarValuesAware
{
    public const STORE_VALUES = 'scalar_values';
    
    /** @return array<string, scalar|null|array> */
    public function getValues(): array;
}
```

This event can be used in different events which needs a simple storage logic:

```php
class SomeFlowAwareEvent extends Event implements ScalarStoreAware, FlowEventAware
{
    public function __construct(private readonly string $url) { }

    public function getValues(): array
    {
        return ['url' => $this->url];
    }
}
```

To store and restore this data, we provide a simple `FlowStorer` implementation:

```php

class ScalarValuesStorer extends FlowStorer
{
    public function store(FlowEventAware $event, array $stored): array
    {
        if (!$event instanceof ScalarValuesAware) return $stored

        $stored[ScalarValuesAware::STORE_VALUES] = $event->getValues();

        return $stored;
    }

    public function restore(StorableFlow $storable): void
    {
        $values = $storable->getStore(ScalarValuesAware::STORE_VALUES);
        foreach ($values as $key => $value) {
            $storable->setData($key, $value);
        }
    }
}
```"
"## Context
The current sw-text-editor in the administration has numerous low-level bugs in basic WYSIWYG features. It is built in a
way that is difficult to maintain and understand. Therefore, we require a new text editor that is easy to maintain, has
a good feature set, is flexible to extend and more stable.","## Decision

We will replace the existing sw-text-editor with a modern, open-source rich text editor library that is widely adopted and actively maintained, such as TinyMCE or CKEditor. This will provide a solid foundation with robust WYSIWYG capabilities, improved stability, and a rich feature set out-of-the-box. Additionally, it offers extensibility through plugins and APIs, ensuring future flexibility. The chosen editor will be integrated as a modular component within the administration UI, with clear documentation and coding standards to facilitate maintenance and understanding by the development team.","## Decision
Building a new text editor from scratch is not a viable option. Therefore, we have evaluated various existing text 
editors and narrowed down our options to the following:

    - CKEditor 5
    - TinyMCE
    - QuillJS
    - Prosemirror
    - TipTap V2
    - Lexical

We have decided to skip CKEditor 5 and TinyMCE because they require a license for our use case and are not 100% open
source. Prosemirror was also ruled out because it provides only a low-level API and requires much more implementation 
time than the other editors. Additionally, Lexical is not a valid option for us since it is specialized for React 
environments and has no official support for VueJS.

The remaining two editors are TipTap V2 and QuillJS. Both have similar feature sets and APIs, but we have found some 
major differences between them. The first difference is that TipTap is a headless editor, which means that it only
provides the editor logic and requires a UI implementation. QuillJS, on the other hand, is a fully featured editor that
provides a UI out of the box. In our case, it is better to use a headless editor like TipTap because we can implement 
the UI to fit our needs, especially for several edge cases that are hard to implement in QuillJS.

The second major difference is in extensibility. TipTap's API is more flexible, allowing us to implement our own
features using the existing TipTap and ProseMirror plugins or build our own plugins. In most cases, the powerful main
TipTap API can already solve most of our use cases. QuillJS, on the other hand, is not as flexible as TipTap, and its
extension system is more complicated to use.

The third big difference is in stability. We found that TipTap is more stable than QuillJS, probably because TipTap is 
built on top of ProseMirror, which is a very stable and well-tested editor. Although QuillJS is also generally stable,
other developers have reported some issues with it in the past.

Our main decision driver was the extensibility of the editor. We want a text editor that is easy to extend and allows us
to implement our own features. TipTap provides a powerful extension system that is easy to use, and we can implement our
design without overwriting an existing design of other editors. Therefore, we have decided to use TipTap as the base of
our new text editor."

The current implementation of the salutation in Shopware 6 needs to handle cases where the salutation is not specified by the customer or administrator. To address this requirement and promote inclusivity, we have updated the default salutation to ""not_specified"" for unspecified salutations in our Shopware 6 platform.","## Decision
We have decided to set the default salutation value to ""not_specified"" in the Shopware 6 system whenever the customer or administrator does not explicitly provide a salutation. This approach ensures consistent handling of unspecified salutations and supports greater inclusivity by avoiding assumptions about the customer's preferred form of address. All components that read or display salutations will treat ""not_specified"" as a valid, neutral default value.","## Decision
We have modified the existing salutation handling in Shopware 6 to update the default value to ""not_specified"" when the salutation is null. This decision was made based on the following considerations:

* Inclusivity: By offering a default salutation of ""not_specified"" for null values, we promote inclusivity and ensure that all customers are appropriately addressed, even when salutation data is missing.
* Customer Experience: Providing a default salutation ensures consistency in customer communications and prevents any confusion or misinterpretation when a salutation is not explicitly specified.
* Non-Deletable Default Salutation: It has been decided that the ""not_specified"" salutation, being the default value for unspecified salutations, should not be deletable by the shop owner. This ensures that there is always a fallback option available, guaranteeing a consistent experience for customers."

The storefront CSS, compiled by `scssphp/scssphp`, is currently automatically prefixed with vendor prefixes using `padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer`.
However, the generated prefixes no longer add much value since the browser support has been updated with the Bootstrap v5 update.
Most of the prefixes are unnecessary for the supported browsers in .browserslist.
Unfortunately, the `theme:compile` process experiences a significant decrease in performance due to the auto-prefixer, which is particularly problematic in our SaaS solution.
Moreover, the `padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer` package does not work dynamically and fails to consider `.browserslist` while applying the appropriate vendor-prefixes.
This package hard-codes the CSS properties that require prefixing, making it an unsustainable long-term solution.
To demonstrate this, a table containing all automatic prefixes generated by `padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer` is provided below.","## Decision

We will remove the use of `padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer` from the `theme:compile` process to improve performance and maintainability. Instead, we will rely solely on the native prefixing support provided by the Bootstrap v5 framework combined with modern browser features, as specified in our updated `.browserslist`.

To ensure that future CSS code remains compatible with our targeted browsers, we will:

- Regularly review and update `.browserslist` to reflect actual browser usage and support requirements.
- Encourage the use of standard, modern CSS properties that do not require vendor prefixes.
- Monitor browser compatibility changes and adjust our approach if new prefixing needs arise.
- Consider integrating a build-time tool based on Node.js (such as PostCSS Autoprefixer) in the future if dynamic prefixing becomes necessary again, since these tools fully support `.browserslist`.

This approach eliminates the dependency on an outdated, hard-coded PHP autoprefixer, significantly improves the compilation speed, and aligns our tooling with modern web standards and browser support.","## Decision

* Due to the above points we have decided to disable the CSS auto-prefixing by default.
* In case it is still needed, to support older browsers or some special CSS property from the table above, it can still be activated via the config key `storefront.theme.auto_prefix_css` in `Storefront/Resources/config/packages/storefront.yaml`. However, we recommend to do a manual prefix inside the SCSS instead.
* We will deprecate the auto-prefixing for v6.6.0 and only use SCSS compiling
* We do not consider the deactivation of the auto-prefixing as a hard breaking change because:
    * Most prefixes are not needed due to current browser support.
    * Some prefixes are for CSS properties which are no longer implemented and developed by browsers.
    * Prefixes which are still valid are primarily cosmetic/appearance properties which are very unlikely to affect the Storefronts functionality."

A pre-release package version is a version followed by a hyphen and an alphanumeric string.

Imagine the following scenario:
* An imaginary package is marked as insecure with version 1.8.7
* The issue is fixed with 2.0.0
* We use version `1.9.0-alpha1`
* Any pre-release package version like `1.9.0-alpha1` is interpreted as `<0.0.0` by npm

Why is this problematic?

The insecurity introduced with version `1.8.7` would never get reported to us by npm, unless we switch to a none pre-release version.","## Decision

We will avoid using pre-release versions (e.g., versions with `-alpha`, `-beta`, or other prerelease tags) for any package versions that are meant to be tracked by npm's security advisories or similar vulnerability reporting mechanisms. Instead, we will:

1. Use official stable semantic versions for all versions that include security-related fixes, ensuring these versions are properly recognized and reported by npm and other vulnerability tools.
2. Reserve pre-release versions strictly for early development purposes, not for releases that need vulnerability tracking.
3. For any intermediate or testing releases, publish them under separate tags or separate distribution channels that do not interfere with npm security metadata.
4. Communicate clearly within the development and release teams about the impact of pre-release versioning on security reporting and enforce policies to prevent inadvertent use of pre-release versions in production or vulnerable code tracking.

This decision ensures that npm's security reporting mechanisms accurately recognize version progressions and vulnerabilities, preventing insecure versions from being inadvertently ignored due to pre-release version ordering semantics.","## Decision
Using pre-release package versions is prohibited.

The existing SQL snippet to delete the outdated cart entries doesn't use any database index to narrow down entries that can be deleted. 
On high traffic shops this leads to SQL query times larger than 30 seconds to find and remove these database entries.

Running 
```
EXPLAIN DELETE FROM cart
WHERE (updated_at IS NULL AND created_at <= '2023-02-01')
   OR (updated_at IS NOT NULL AND updated_at <= '2023-02-01') LIMIT 1000;
```
shows that the original sql query doesn't use an index (`possible_keys` = `NULL`)","## Decision

To improve the performance of the cleanup query for outdated cart entries, we will create a composite database index on the `cart` table covering the `updated_at` and `created_at` columns. This index will allow the DELETE query to efficiently locate entries eligible for deletion by leveraging the timestamp conditions in the WHERE clause.

Specifically, the index will be defined as:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_cart_updated_created ON cart (updated_at, created_at);
```

Following the index creation, the DELETE query will be updated to include the existing LIMIT clause to batch the deletions and avoid long-running transactions.

This approach is expected to reduce query times significantly by enabling the database engine to use the index for filtering outdated entries instead of scanning the entire cart table. It also supports incremental cleanup without locking the table for extended periods.

If future performance issues arise, further optimizations such as partitioning or a dedicated purge process may be considered.","## Decision

Reorder the query parameters so that the relevant cart entries can be narrowed down by an indexed field.

Currently, it is hard to publish features in an early state to gather feedback regarding those features. If they are useful, what needs to be improved etc.
One major reason is that everything we publish (that is not marked as internal) is part of our backwards compatibility promise, thus changing foundational parts of features is quite hard after first release.
That leads to features being developed over quite some time without getting actual feedback from users or being able to release them, as they need to be implemented to a pretty final state in order to confidently release them in a stable manner, where we will keep backwards compatibility.

This at the same time also means that the current approach is not beneficial to our ecosystem, whom the whole backwards compatibility promise should benefit, because the features are built behind closed curtains they can't chime in with ideas and use cases regarding extendability, etc.

Examples of features that could benefit from an earlier experimental release:
* B2B:
  * We could release the multi account B2B feature with a ""simple"" employee management system first, and then add the more complex budget management or access control on top of that later.
* Advanced Search:
  * We could release a first version of the new advanced search feature, without all configuration options and customizability that we might envision.

In both cases, releasing the first increments of the features without an ""experimental""-flag would mean that we would have to keep backwards compatibility for the whole feature, even if we later decide to change the implementation of the feature, thus making the development of the feature harder.
Also in getting feedback from the customers what additional functionalities are needed after we released the first foundational increment of the feature, we can base our further prioritization on real customer feedback.
Thus, we can ship business value sooner to our customers and lower the risk of building the wrong thing.","## Decision

We will introduce an ""experimental feature flag"" mechanism that allows us to release early-stage, incomplete, or evolving features to selected users or environments without the usual backwards compatibility guarantees. Features marked as experimental will be clearly labeled, and their APIs and behaviors may change significantly before becoming a stable, officially supported part of the product.

This approach enables us to:

- Launch foundational increments of complex features earlier to gather real user feedback.
- Iterate rapidly on experimental features without the constraints of backwards compatibility.
- Involve customers and ecosystem partners in shaping feature development via early access.
- Lower development risk by validating assumptions before committing to a stable implementation.

Once an experimental feature matures and stabilizes based on feedback and internal quality assessment, it will graduate to stable status with full backwards compatibility assurances. This process will be documented and communicated clearly to all stakeholders.","## Decision

To ship features earlier, we add the concept of ""experimental"" features, thus giving early access to meaningful increments of features that are still in active development.
That means in particular that there is no backwards compatibility promise for experimental features, thus we can change the implementation as is needed, without having to worry about breaking changes.
We mark the code for those features with a new `experimental` annotation, to make it clear on code level that the API is **not yet** stable.
For code where already expect that it should never become part of the public API we will use the `@internal` annotation directly, to make sure that even if the feature is stable we will continue to tread those parts of the code as internal and not keep backwards compatible.
Everything that is marked with `@experimental` is designed to be part of the public API, when the feature is stable.

At the same time, it offers a way for the ecosystem to give early feedback on the feature, as well as to test it in their own projects. Especially, extension developers can check how they might want to integrate and extend the feature being built, and thus suggest the needed extension points during the development process.
To make this possible that means that there also will be documentation (API docs, dev docs and user docs) for experimental features

All experimental features are developed with a specific target version, beginning with that version, the feature is considered stable, and the APIs will be kept backwards compatible.
This means that `experimental` annotation/attribute have to be removed, before the version can be released. Because it is hard to estimate exactly with which release a feature may be stable (as it also depends on the feedback we get) it makes sense to mark them as being stable with the next major version.
That does not mean that the feature won't be finished and stable earlier (we can remove the experimental status with any minor version), it only means that at the latest with that version it is considered stable, this prevents a situation where a lot of features stay in the experimental state for a long time."

The stock handling in Shopware 6 is currently not very flexible and does not support many common use cases. 

* It's not possible to easily replace the loading of stocks with a custom implementation, for example one that communicates with an ERP.
* It's not possible to easily modify how stock is increased/decreased throughout the order lifecycle.
* Available stock calculation is very slow on large catalogs.
* Stock is stored as two distinct values: stock and available stock. This is due to the fact that stock is not reduced until an order is set as completed. Therefore, the available stock is calculated as the stock minus all open orders. This is unnecessarily complex.","## Decision

To address the inflexibility and performance issues with stock handling in Shopware 6, we will redesign the stock management system with the following decisions:

1. **Introduce a Stock Service Interface:**  
   Define a clear interface for stock management that encapsulates all stock-related operations (loading, increasing, decreasing, reserving). This interface will allow projects to easily provide custom implementations, such as integrations with external ERP systems.

2. **Event-Driven Stock Modification:**  
   Implement an event-driven architecture for stock changes during the order lifecycle. By dispatching events on order state transitions (e.g., order placed, order paid, order completed), subscribers can modify how stock quantities are increased or decreased, enabling custom behavior without modifying core logic.

3. **Single Source of Truth for Stock Quantity:**  
   Consolidate stock values into a single authoritative stock quantity. Eliminate the maintenance of separate 'stock' and 'available stock' fields by managing stock reservations explicitly. Available stock will be computed on demand by subtracting reserved stock from total stock, simplifying consistency and reducing complexity.

4. **Optimize Stock Availability Calculations:**  
   Improve performance of stock availability calculations by caching reservation data, utilizing database indexes, and minimizing query complexity. This will speed up availability checks on large catalogs.

These changes will make stock handling more extensible, maintainable, and performant while supporting a wider range of business scenarios.","## Decision

We have only one field `stock` in the product definition which always has a real time calculated value.

The `stock` value should be correctly updated as an order and its line items transition through the various states. Eg, stock is decremented when an order is placed. If it is cancelled, the stock is increased, and so on.

We have a clear API for manipulating stock which can be extended and supports arbitrary data, which could, for example, support features such as multi warehouse inventory.

We have a way to disable the stock handling behavior of Shopware."

By default, every exception that is thrown in the PHP stack and not caught will be logged by the `symfony/monolog-bridge` on `error` level.
But there are some cases where the exception is caused by clients accessing the API wrong (missing fields etc.) and throwing an `ShopwareHttpException` with an HTTP-Status-Code of 40x is our way of handling such situations and returning a correct HTTP-Status-Code to the client.
So those cases are in fact no ""errors"" that need to be analyzed, but are expected given a malformed API request.
Logging those cases as ""errors"" produces a lot of noise, which makes it harder to actually find errors in the logs.

For our cloud product, we already used a configuration list that configures that some Exception classes should only be logged as notices.","## Decision

We will adopt a configurable exception logging level system that downgrades logging severity for expected client-caused exceptions such as `ShopwareHttpException` with 4xx status codes. Specifically, exceptions matching configured classes (e.g., `ShopwareHttpException`) will be logged at the `notice` level instead of the default `error` level.

This approach reduces noise in the logs by preventing expected client errors from being treated as server errors, improving signal-to-noise ratio and enabling faster identification of genuine issues. The configuration will be extensible to support additional exception classes or hierarchies in the future.

The existing logging infrastructure (`symfony/monolog-bridge`) will be leveraged and customized by adjusting the log level dynamically based on the exception type and HTTP status code at the point of logging, ensuring minimal impact on existing error handling flows.","## Decision

We add a configuration to the platform that degrades the error level of specific exceptions to notices. This way, external hosters can also profit from our classification.
We use [symfony's `exceptions` configuration](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/framework.html#exceptions) for this.

This has the benefit that for specific projects this configuration could be adjusted, for example, for cases where you also control all clients that access the shop, you may want to log also every client error, just to help debugging the client.

Another solution could be to do the configuration of the log level directly in the exception class either by attributes or a separate method specifying the log level, but that would make overwriting it for a specific project harder, so we stick to the default symfony configuration."

Using UUIDs as primary keys eases the integration of several different data sources,
but it also brings some performance issues.

Currently, we're using UUIDv4, which is a random UUID the completely random prefix means
that the B-tree indexes of the database are not very efficient.

UUIDv7 time-based prefix is less spread than that of UUIDv4, this helps the database to keep the index more compact.
It allows the Index to allocate fewer new pages and to keep the index smaller.","## Decision

We will migrate from UUIDv4 to UUIDv7 for our primary keys. This change leverages the time-based prefix of UUIDv7 to improve the locality of inserts in our database indexes, leading to better performance. By using UUIDv7, the B-tree indexes will experience fewer page splits and reduced fragmentation, allowing them to remain more compact and efficient. This decision balances the need for globally unique identifiers with the desire to optimize database write and query performance.","## Decision

Considering there is little risk to using UUIDv7, as v4 and v7 share the same
length and are indistinguishable for shopware, we can switch to v7 without any risk
of breaking anything.

The effort is also very low as we only need to change the
implementation of the `Uuid` class. As using UUIDv7 will improve the speed of
bulk product inserts by about 8 %, we think the effort is worth the measurable and
theoretical gain."

To address the limitation of apps not being able to extend the list of available events in the flow builder, we will introduce a plugin system that allows apps to register custom events.

The flow builder will be enhanced to dynamically discover and display these custom events alongside built-in events, enabling users to incorporate them seamlessly into their flows.

Right now only Shopware Backend is able to communicate with the App Server in a secure way.
This is because the App Server is able to verify the origin of the request by checking request signature, 
and this signature is generated by the Shopware 6 backend application with a shop to app server secret.

When an app wants to communicate directly with the App Server,
the App Server is not able to verify the origin of the request and has to trust the client.
This works fine for public available data, but not when you reliably need the logged-in customer and other information.","## Decision

To securely allow apps to communicate directly with the App Server and reliably identify the logged-in customer, we will implement an OAuth 2.0 based authentication mechanism between the apps and the App Server. 

The Shopware Backend will act as an authorization server issuing access tokens to the apps after authenticating the user. The apps will then include these access tokens in their requests to the App Server. The App Server will validate the tokens to verify the request origin and extract the user context securely, without having to trust the client blindly.

This approach ensures that:
- Only authenticated and authorized apps can access customer-specific data.
- The App Server can reliably verify the identity of the requesting party.
- The existing secure communication between the Shopware Backend and the App Server remains intact.","## Decision

We provide a new endpoint `/store-api/app-system/{appName}/generate-token` (`/app-system/{appName}/generate-token` in Storefront) which generates a JWT token for the given app.
This endpoint requires that the customer is logged-in and the app is installed and active. 

The JWT token contains claims like:
- `iat` - issued at
- `exp` - expiration time
- `shopId` - the shop id of the current shop
- `salesChannelId` - the sales channel id of the current sales channel
- `customerId` - the customer id of the logged-in customer
- `cartToken` - the cart token of the current cart

The additional claims are bound to app permissions when an app does not have permissions to read a customer,
it does not get the `customerId` claim.

The JWT token is signed with the shop to app server secret key which we use already for the signature.
So the App Server needs to be able to verify the JWT key and use the claims in a secure way.
The request body of the client is still untrusted and has to be properly validated by the app server.

The request cycle would look like this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Shopware Backend
    participant App Server
    Client->>Shopware Backend: GET /store-api/app-system/TestApp/generate-token
    Shopware Backend->>Client: Responds with Signed JWT Token
    Client->>App Server: Post /product-review/submit containing JWT in header
```

The JWT token is valid for 15 minutes and can be used multiple times until expired.
The client should save it in the [session storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)
and request it only on expiry again.
Additionally, the API route should be rate limited to not generate too often an expensive JWT key."

In the past merchants had to deal with issues where their custom-built flow did not
behave how they intended it to do. An concrete example: We've had a merchant that contacted
us (shopware) that their shop did not sent out mails. Debugging the flow turned out to
be harder than we thought and honestly harder than it should be. The flow builder should
empower users to build reliable flows and not spend their precious time trying to
figure out what went wrong.

To improve the experience when using the Flow Builder were taking measures. First,
Flow Builder Preview and second Flow Builder Logging. This ADR only discusses the former one,
there are plans internally for the latter one, but it won't get much attention for now, as
it also addresses different issues (what does my flow do vs what went wrong in the past).

Users should be able to preview a flow and get further understanding on how a flow executes.
This preview only displays the steps and decisions happening inside a flow but doesn't
execute / simulate the real flow","## Decision

To enhance user understanding and confidence in their custom flows, we will implement a Flow Builder Preview feature. This preview will visually represent the sequence of steps and decisions within a flow without actually executing or simulating the flow's real effects. By doing so, users can verify and comprehend the logical structure of their flows before deploying them, reducing ambiguity and debugging time. This approach strikes a balance between providing clarity and avoiding the complexity and risks associated with full flow simulation or execution during preview.","## Decision

In the current media system it is possible to configure different `Shopware\Core\Content\Media\Pathname\PathnameStrategy\PathnameStrategyInterface`.

These strategies are used to store files, which are uploaded for media entity, under a certain path.

The configured strategy is then also used to generate the URL that is used in the frontend/store API to embed the file.

The generation of this URL is currently triggered in an event subscriber which is registered to the `media.loaded` event.

For generating the URL an implementation of the `UrlGeneratorInterface` is used.
```php
interface UrlGeneratorInterface
{
    public function getAbsoluteMediaUrl(MediaEntity $media): string;

    public function getRelativeMediaUrl(MediaEntity $media): string;

    public function getAbsoluteThumbnailUrl(MediaEntity $media, MediaThumbnailEntity $thumbnail): string;

    public function getRelativeThumbnailUrl(MediaEntity $media, MediaThumbnailEntity $thumbnail): string;

     * Generate the cache buster part of the path, missing from url if omitted
     */
    public function generatePathCacheBuster(MediaEntity $media, ?MediaThumbnailEntity $thumbnail = null): ?string;

    /**
     * Generate the filename
     */
    public function generatePhysicalFilename(MediaEntity $media, ?MediaThumbnailEntity $thumbnail = null): string;
}
```","## Decision

We will continue using the existing event-driven approach where the URL generation for media files is triggered via the `media.loaded` event subscriber. The subscriber will invoke the configured `PathnameStrategyInterface` implementation along with the `UrlGeneratorInterface` to generate the appropriate URLs and paths for the media entity and its thumbnails.

This approach provides a clean separation of concerns:
- The storage path logic is encapsulated within the `PathnameStrategyInterface` implementations, allowing different strategies to be plugged in easily.
- The URL generation is delegated to the `UrlGeneratorInterface`, ensuring consistent URL formatting.
- Using an event subscriber for `media.loaded` guarantees URLs are generated only when the media entity is fully loaded, avoiding unnecessary work and ensuring URLs are ready before media is used downstream (e.g. in the frontend or Store API).

No immediate refactoring to this pattern is necessary, but we will ensure:
- All new pathname strategies fully implement the `PathnameStrategyInterface`.
- The event subscriber properly handles both media entities and thumbnails and uses the configured URL generator.
- URL generation logic is cleanly separated from storage concerns for maintainability and extensibility.

In summary:
- Retain the event-driven URL generation triggered on `media.loaded`.
- Use `PathnameStrategyInterface` to generate physical paths and cache busters.
- Use `UrlGeneratorInterface` to convert those paths into usable URLs.
- Ensure extensibility and consistency through interface contracts and event-driven design.","## Decision
To address the issues listed above, we will make the following changes to the system:

- The file path will be saved directly to the media entity (and thumbnail) when the file is uploaded.
    - This way we don't have to access the strategy when generating the URL, which might have changed in the meantime.
- We allow to change the file path via API and write it directly when creating the entity
    - This way files can be synchronized directly with an external storage and the path only has to be changed in the entity or given during import.
- To generate the strategy we use new location structs, which can be easily created via a service.
    - So we remove the dependency to the DAL to generate the file path.
- For generating the URL, we implement a new service, which can be operated without entities.
    - The URL generation is more resource efficient and can be done without fully loaded entities.
- The new URL generator uses a new ""cache busting"" system, which writes the updated at timestamp of the media entity as query parameter into the URL.
    - This way the file path can remain the same even if the file is updated. Changes to the entity's meta data will also result in a new URL."

We often need a way between the different Shopware versions to provide a one-time update for data. This is currently done on the way to extend an indexer to this logic and then trigger this via a migration. 
This is of course a possible way to enable certain migrations of data, but this migration is also executed again and again when the indexer is executed. 
With certain data this is critical and can lead to system errors. For example, the one-time migration of media path information.","## Decision

To address the issue of repeatedly executing one-time data migrations during indexer runs, we will separate one-time migration logic from the indexer execution process. Specifically, we will implement a dedicated migration framework or mechanism that ensures one-time data updates are executed only once per Shopware version upgrade.

This will involve:

- Moving all one-time update logic out of the indexer extensions and into version-specific migration scripts or handlers.
- Introducing idempotency checks or migration state tracking to guarantee each migration runs only once.
- Triggering these migrations explicitly during the update process or via database migration steps, rather than during every indexer run.
- Ensuring the indexer remains focused solely on indexing tasks without side-effects from migration code.

This separation reduces the risk of critical errors caused by repeated data modifications, ensures clearer lifecycle management of data migrations, and aligns with best practices for controlled system upgrades.","## Decision

We implement a new `PostUpdateIndexer`. This is an extension of the `EntityIndexer` and the system can be adapted 1:1. Also, the indexing registration via database migration can be adapted 1:1. 
However, the indexer is not triggered via the `IndexerRegistry` when a full re-index or an entity written event is triggered.
These indexers are only included after the update process.
In addition to the one-time update of the data, we then often also provide a command that can be used to trigger the migration of the data again."

Our current development process uses ['Experimental features'](./2023-05-10-experimental-features.md) to publish features in an early state to gather feedback regarding those features.
During the implementation, developers may encounter challenges related to the effective management of extensive code scattered throughout the platform, particularly in connection with specific experimental features. This codebase fragmentation presents impediments to the tracking, maintenance, and comprehensive understanding of each feature's scope, thereby hindering our development progress.
 
Potential problems:
* Update `stableVersion` property for Prolonged Experiments
    * When a decision is made to extend an experiment, locating all relevant sections of code for updating the property `stableVersion` in `@experimental` annotation becomes a cumbersome task.
* Deprecation of Killed Features
    * Identifying and marking as deprecated the components associated with a deprecated experimental feature is problematic, particularly when multiple experimental features coexist simultaneously within the platform.
    * The ['Experimental features'](./2023-05-10-experimental-features.md) stipulates the ""Killing Feature"" rule, which mandates that a feature must remain within the platform's codebase until the next major version and be appropriately marked as deprecated. However, it is hardly possible to check with current annotation.

In all the above case main problem is detection to which feature belongs experimental code.","# Decision

We will introduce a centralized experimental feature registry and enforce consistent scoping annotations tied to explicit feature identifiers throughout the codebase.

## Rationale

To address the difficulty in managing scattered experimental feature code, each experimental feature will be assigned a unique feature ID and recorded in a centralized registry (e.g., a JSON or YAML configuration file).

All experimental code elements—classes, methods, components—will be annotated with a structured annotation or decorator that includes this explicit feature ID alongside the existing `@experimental` and `stableVersion` properties.

This explicit linkage will enable automated tooling (scripts or IDE plugins) to:

- Identify all code related to a specific experimental feature,
- Track and update the `stableVersion` when prolonging an experiment,
- Detect components to mark as deprecated once a feature is killed,
- Generate reports on experimental feature coverage, lifespan, and status.

Automating these processes reduces manual code inspection and error-prone updates, ultimately improving maintainability, traceability, and compliance with the ""Killing Feature"" rule.

## Implications

- Developers must adopt the structured annotation convention for new and refactored experimental code.
- Build or CI tooling requires enhancement to parse the centralized registry and scan code annotations.
- Legacy experimental code needs auditing to add missing feature identifiers.
- The registry must be maintained rigorously alongside the feature lifecycle.

This decision balances overhead in setup with significant gains in clarity, tracking, and streamlined maintenance of experimental features.","## Decision
To address the existing challenges, we propose implementing a refined approach to the use of the `@experimental` annotation. 

The key modifications are as follows:
* Mandatory `feature` property: 
  * Every `@experimental` annotation will now require a mandatory `feature` property. This property is a string that must contain the name of the associated feature.
* Uniform feature Naming: 
  * To enhance code organization and traceability, all sections of code related to a particular feature must use the same feature name in the `feature` property of the `@experimental` annotation.
  * Feature names should follow the conventions.
    * Feature names cannot contain spaces
    * Feature names should be written in `ALL_CAPS`."

In the current implementation, there exists a challenge for extension developers in uniquely identifying payment and shipping methods using identifiers.
This issue is particularly significant for app servers, as it necessitates calls to the Shopware Admin API for the identification of payment and shipping methods based on their respective IDs.","## Decision
To address the challenge of uniquely identifying payment and shipping methods, we will introduce globally unique string identifiers for both payment and shipping methods. These identifiers will be stable and consistent across all environments and instances, enabling extension developers and app servers to reference methods directly without additional API calls.

Specifically, the system will:
- Assign a unique, human-readable string identifier (e.g., ""paypal_express"" or ""flat_rate_shipping"") to each payment and shipping method.
- Ensure that these identifiers remain constant even if the underlying numeric IDs change.
- Expose these identifiers via APIs and in method metadata, allowing app servers and extensions to use them as primary references.

This approach reduces API call overhead, simplifies method referencing in extensions and apps, and improves overall system extensibility and developer experience.","## Decision
We will introduce a new property called `technicalName` to both the `payment_method` and `shipping_method` entities.
This `technicalName` property will serve as a unique identifier for payment and shipping methods, significantly simplifying the identification process.

While the `technicalName` field will be optional within the database and API to ensure backward compatibility, it will be made mandatory in the Administration.
This ensures that merchants will update their payment and shipping methods accordingly for the upcoming requirement.
An unique index will ensure uniqueness.
Starting from version 6.7.0.0, this `technicalName` field will also become required within the database and the API.

As part of the database migration process, the `technicalName` field will be automatically generated for the default payment and shipping methods provided by Shopware, as illustrated below:

| Type     | Name             | Technical Name          |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Payment  | Debit            | payment_debitpayment    |
| Payment  | Invoice          | payment_invoicepayment  |
| Payment  | Cash on Delivery | payment_cashpayment     |
| Payment  | Pre Payment      | payment_prepayment      |
| Shipping | Standard         | shipping_standard       |
| Shipping | Express          | shipping_express        |

Furthermore, all payment and shipping methods provided by apps will also benefit from the automatic generation of their `technicalName`.
This generation will be based on the app's name and the `identifier` defined for the payment method in the manifest:

| App Name | Identifier         | Technical Name                    |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| MyApp    | my_payment_method  | payment_MyApp_my_payment_method   |
| MyApp    | my_shipping_method | shipping_MyApp_my_shipping_method |"
"## Context

At the moment the Storefront is implementing a lot of custom SCSS inside `app/storefront/src/scss`.
Some custom SCSS is not necessary, and it already exists within Bootstrap as a utility.
For example default spacing with a custom selector:

```scss
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
    margin-bottom: $spacer;
}
```

This can be replaced with a Bootstrap [spacing utility](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/spacing/) in the HTML and the SCSS can be completely removed:

```diff
- <div class=""register-login-collapse-toogle""><div>
+ <div class=""register-login-collapse-toogle mb-3""><div>
```

A class like `register-login-collapse-toogle` should stay in the HTML in case a developer wants to style this specific element.
But there is no need to introduce a new CSS rule using a custom selector to apply a default spacing.

If you implement new UI using mostly utility classes, please consider to still add CSS classes that offer the possibility for themes to add individual styling. For example:

```html
<!-- Classes ""shipping-modal-actions"", ""shipping-abort"" and ""shipping-submit"" are added for better semantics and CSS extensibility, but ship no default CSS. -->
<div class=""border p-3 mb-3 shipping-modal-actions"">
    <button class=""btn btn-light shipping-abort"">Abort</button>
    <button class=""btn btn-primary shipping-submit"">Submit</button>
</div>
```

This principle cannot be applied everywhere. 
For more complex layouts it can still be valid to use custom SCSS because it is not possible to build with default components and utilities, or it would produce a messy template with too many generic utility classes. 
However, for simpler stuff like ""add a border here, add some spacing there"" it's not necessary to implement additional custom styling.","## Decision

We will adopt a styling convention that prioritizes the use of Bootstrap’s built-in utility classes for common CSS properties such as spacing, borders, and padding in our storefront codebase. Custom SCSS rules will be minimized and only applied when necessary for complex layouts or specific theming needs that cannot be addressed by utilities alone.

To support flexibility and future theming, semantic CSS classes with no default styles will still be added to relevant HTML elements. This approach ensures that developers can easily target and extend styles without relying on redundant custom CSS for simple styling concerns.

This decision leads to cleaner, more maintainable stylesheets, reduces duplication, and leverages Bootstrap’s tested utilities to improve consistency and development velocity.","## Decision

We want to make more use of Bootstrap utilities and get rid of custom SCSS that is not needed.

In order to do so we want to remove unneeded SCSS and add a utility class to the HTML instead (e.g. `mb-3`).
However, this can break styling overrides of themes/apps because most Bootstrap utility classes apply `!important` by default.

Let's stick to the example of `.register-login-collapse-toogle`.
* The core Storefront adds a bottom margin of `$spacer` which equals `1rem`.
* Then `CustomTheme` overrides this selector with a margin bottom of `80px`:

```diff
/* CustomTheme */
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
+    margin-bottom: 80px;
}

/* Storefront */
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
-    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

If the core Storefront would migrate to the utility class it would suddenly overrule the styling of `CustomTheme` because of the `!important` property:

```diff
/* Utility class from HTML overrules CustomTheme */
.mb-3 {
+    margin-bottom: 1rem !important;
}

/* CustomTheme */
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
-    margin-bottom: 80px;
}

/* Storefront */
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
-    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

The theme developer would have no other choice other than using `!important` as well, or modifying the Twig template.

Because of this, we have decided to remove the `!important` from Bootstrap utility classes by changing the [Importance](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/api/#importance) variable `$enable-important-utilities` to `false`.
By doing this, we can use more utilities while at the same time allowing themes to override the same CSS property without using `!important` or editing the template.

Since it is currently expected that Bootstrap utilities add `!important` and overrule almost everything, we do not want to change this right away but from `v6.6.0` onwards."
"## Context
For our ambitions to consequently reduce manual testing in favour for test automation the current E2E test suite, based on Cypress, is not sufficient anymore. It has several flaws that have become a big road-blocker. The test suite is tightly coupled to the state of the test environment, which leads to tests that are not very deterministic and tend to be slow and flaky. Tests are often created in different ways and don't follow a specific strategy. In addition, the test suite is currently not able to test against our cloud environment.

Our goal is to create a test suite that fulfills the following requirements:

*  Deterministic tests that can run against any environment.
*  Fast and reliable tests that follow a certain test strategy.
*  Tests that are derived from real product requirements and validate behaviour.
*  A test framework that is easy to learn and using a readable syntax that also non-tech people can comprehend.","## Decision

We will replace the current Cypress-based E2E test suite with a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework leveraging tools such as Cucumber or Gauge, combined with a stable test automation library like Playwright or TestCafe.

This approach addresses the outlined goals as follows:

- **Deterministic tests and environment agnostic:** By designing tests that abstract away environment-specific details and mocking or controlling external dependencies where appropriate, tests will reliably run against local, staging, and cloud environments without flaky results.

- **Fast and reliable tests with a clear strategy:** Adopting a test strategy based on well-defined user journeys or business capabilities ensures consistency in test creation. Using Playwright or TestCafe offers faster cross-browser support and better built-in handling of asynchronous events compared to Cypress, which reduces flakiness.

- **Requirement-derived tests validating behavior:** By adopting BDD, test cases are derived directly from product requirements and user stories, ensuring that tests validate meaningful business behavior.

- **Readable syntax for non-technical stakeholders:** Writing tests in Gherkin syntax (Given-When-Then) makes them accessible and easy to understand for non-developers, enabling better collaboration and review.

In addition, we will establish guidelines and training on test writing and maintenance to enforce consistency and foster the shift toward automation-first testing culture.","## Decision
In order to achieve this goal we decided to not further invest time in the existing test suite, but start from scratch. This offers the opportunity to also switch to another test framework that better fulfills our needs. 

After some evaluation we chose Playwright as the new test framework. First benchmarks have shown that it is faster and more stable than Cypress. Additionally, it is easy to learn, has very good documentation and uses a syntax that is easily to understand. It also offers the functionality of creating reusable traces, which come in handy when debugging failing tests from pipelines."
"## Context
1. If flow actions want to interact with the database in a transactional manner, they need to handle it themselves by starting and committing transactions.

2. When there is a problem committing the transaction, the error will be caught and ignored by the flow dispatcher. A vague error message will be logged, but the flows will continue to execute.
This is problematic if a transaction was already started before the flow is executed. If the connection is configured without save points (which is the default with Shopware), when a nested commit fails (eg during a flow action) the connection will be marked as rollback only.
When the outer transaction attempts to commit, eg the calling code, it will be unaware of the previous inner commit failure and thus will also fail.","## Decision  
To ensure reliable transactional behavior and proper error handling within flows, all database transaction management will be centralized and enforced outside of individual flow actions. Specifically, the system will handle transaction demarcation at a higher level rather than relying on flow actions to start and commit transactions themselves.

1. The flow dispatcher will no longer ignore commit errors silently. Instead, it will propagate transaction commit exceptions to the caller to ensure failures are visible and can be handled appropriately.

2. Nested transactions will be avoided or properly supported using savepoints if necessary. Given the default lack of savepoints in Shopware connections, the system will prevent flow actions from independently committing transactions to avoid marking the connection as rollback-only unknowingly.

3. Flow actions will be designed to operate within the scope of an existing transaction managed externally, thereby ensuring transactional consistency and clear error reporting throughout the flows.

This approach guarantees that transactional boundaries are well-defined and controlled, preventing hidden errors during nested commits and improving the robustness and maintainability of flow executions interacting with the database.","## Decision

We introduce a new marker interface `\Shopware\Core\Content\Flow\Dispatching\TransactionalAction` which flow actions can implement.

The flow executor will wrap any action in a database transaction which implements the interface.

Before:

```php
class SetOrderStateAction extends FlowAction implements DelayableAction
{
    public function handleFlow(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {
        $this->connection->beginTransaction();
        
        //do stuff
        
        try {
            $this->connection->commit();
        } catch (\Throwable $e) {
                
        }
    }
}
```

After:

```php

class SetOrderStateAction extends FlowAction implements DelayableAction, TransactionalAction
{
    public function handleFlow(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {        
        //do stuff - will be wrapped in a transaction
    }
}
```

You can also force the flow executor to rollback the transaction by throwing an instance of `\Shopware\Core\Content\Flow\Dispatching\TransactionFailedException`. You can use the static `because` method to create the exception from another one. Eg:

```php

class SetOrderStateAction extends FlowAction implements DelayableAction, TransactionalAction
{
    public function handleFlow(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {        
        try {
            //search for some record
            $entity = $this->repo->find(...);
        } catch (NotFoundException $e) {
            throw TransactionFailedException::because($e);
        }
    }
}
```

The transaction will be rollback if either of the following are true:

1. If Doctrine throws an instance of `Doctrine\DBAL\Exception` during commit.
2. If the action throws an instance of `TransactionFailedException` during execution.
3. If another non-handled exception is thrown during the action execution. This is to aid debugging.

If the transaction fails, then the error will be logged. Also, if the transaction has been performed inside a nested transaction without save points enabled, the exception will be rethrown.
So that the calling code knows something went wrong and is able to handle it correctly, by rolling back instead of committing. As, in this instance, the connection will be marked as rollback only."

Vue 3 introduced a new compatibility mode to ease the migration from Vue 2 to Vue 3. This mode is enabled by default
and allows the use of most Vue 2 features in a Vue 3 application. This mode is only recommended for the transition period
and should be turned off as soon as possible.

We have kept the compatibility mode enabled in the administration because it makes it easier for plugins to migrate 
and results in fewer breaking changes during the major release. This splits the work of migrating the administration
and the plugins into two separate majors instead of one.","## Decision

We have decided to keep the Vue 3 compatibility mode enabled in the administration application for the duration of the transition period. This approach allows the administration to continue supporting most Vue 2 features, thereby minimizing breaking changes during the major release. It also enables plugin developers to migrate their plugins independently and at a more manageable pace, effectively splitting the migration effort into two separate major updates: one for the administration and one for the plugins.

This decision prioritizes a smoother and less disruptive migration experience for both the core administration and plugin ecosystem. Once the plugins have been updated and the migration is complete, we will disable the compatibility mode to fully embrace Vue 3's new features and improvements.","## Decision

Migrating all components in one by disabling the compatibility mode for the whole administration is a huge task and
would make it hard to keep the administration stable during the migration. We decided to disable the compatibility mode
per component level. This allows us to migrate components one by one and keep the administration stable during the migration.

This gives all teams and plugin developers the possibility to migrate their components to Vue 3 without waiting for the
whole administration to be migrated and for the global removal of the compatibility mode.

To activate the new mode, the `DISABLE_VUE_COMPAT` feature flag must be enabled. Then, it is possible to disable the
compatibility mode on a per-component level by setting the `compatConfig` option in the component to our custom configuration.
This custom configuration is exposed in `Shopware.compatConfig` and has all compatibility features disabled if the 
feature flag is activated."

It was brought to our attention that the latest version of Vuex `4.1.0` contains a bug that destroys getter reactivity under specific circumstances. The proposed fix was to downgrade to `4.0.2`. However, downgrading was not possible as `4.0.2` contains other bugs that caused modules to fail.","## Decision  
Given the critical bug in Vuex `4.1.0` that breaks getter reactivity and the incompatibility issues in `4.0.2`, we have decided to refrain from downgrading Vuex at this time. Instead, we will:  

- Temporarily freeze the Vuex version at `4.1.0` and implement workarounds in the application code to mitigate the getter reactivity issues where possible.  
- Monitor the Vuex repository closely for patches or updates that address the getter reactivity bug without introducing new module failures.  
- Evaluate alternative state management libraries or solutions if the issue persists beyond a reasonable timeframe and severely impacts application stability or developer productivity.  

This approach balances stability and reactivity correctness until an official fix is released.","## Decision

In our current architecture, we rely heavily on PHP decoration, Adapter, and Factory patterns to allow for extensions and customizations by third-party developers. While these patterns are effective, they present significant challenges:

1. **Backward and Forward Compatibility:**
    - Maintaining backward and forward compatibility with these patterns is complex and labor-intensive. Each change or update can potentially break existing extensions or require extensive rework to ensure compatibility.

2. **Process Extension Limitations:**
    - These patterns do not inherently allow for the extension of subprocesses unless these subprocesses are extracted into separate classes and interfaces. This extraction often results in a proliferation of interfaces, abstract classes, and their implementations.

3. **Proliferation of Code:**
    - The need to extract subprocesses into separate entities leads to an overwhelming number of interfaces and abstract classes. This proliferation makes the codebase more difficult to understand and maintain, and increases the cognitive load on developers.","## Decision

To address these challenges, we will transition from relying primarily on PHP decoration, Adapter, and Factory patterns toward a more modular and declarative extension mechanism based on a plugin architecture coupled with event-driven and service container approaches.

Specifically:

- **Adopt a Plugin System:** Introduce a formal plugin system where extensions can register themselves via configuration files or metadata, enabling clean and explicit extension points without pervasive use of decoration or adapters.

- **Leverage Event-Driven Architecture:** Use an event dispatcher to allow third-party developers to hook into key lifecycle events and subprocesses, facilitating extensibility without rigid inheritance hierarchies or deep decoration chains.

- **Utilize Dependency Injection Container:** Employ a service container to manage dependencies and allow for flexible substitution or decoration of services in a more controlled manner, improving maintainability and testability.

This approach will reduce coupling, improve backward and forward compatibility by isolating extensions, and minimize the proliferation of interfaces and abstract classes by centralizing extension points and subprocess hooks. It will also lower the cognitive load on developers by providing clear, declarative mechanisms for extension and customization.","## Decision

To address these challenges, we have decided to transition to an event-based extension system. This new approach will replace the existing decoration, Adapter, and Factory patterns as the primary method for extending and customizing our system."

Currently, our component tests in Jest are running with enabled compat mode. To remove the compat mode for each
component, we need to add a new Jest runner with disabled compat mode to make sure that the tests are running without compat mode.","## Decision

We will introduce a new Jest runner configuration specifically for running component tests with compat mode disabled. This new runner will coexist alongside the existing compat mode runner, allowing us to gradually migrate components to run without compat mode. By doing this, we can ensure tests run accurately in both modes during the transition period without disrupting existing test coverage. Over time, as all components are updated and verified to work without compat mode, we will deprecate and remove the compat mode runner configuration.","## Decision

I added a new runner command in the NPM scripts to run the Jest tests without compat mode. The new runner command is
`unit:disabled-compat` and `unit-watch:disabled-compat`. Also, the composer commands are added to run the tests. These commands are `admin:unit:disabled-compat` and `admin:unit-watch:disabled-compat`. These commands are using the environment variable `DISABLE_JEST_COMPAT_MODE` to disable the compat mode.

For the pipeline, I added a new stage to run the Jest tests without compat mode. The stage is `Jest (Administration with disabled compat mode)`.

To mark a test file working without the compat mode you need to add a comment with the `@group` tag. The tag is `@group disabledCompat`.

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * @package admin
 * @group disabledCompat
 */

import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils';

async function createWrapper() {
...
```

With this tag, the test file is running without compat mode. To make a component working for both modes, you can use the
compatUtils helper function from Vue compat:
```javascript
// Example
import { compatUtils } from '@vue/compat';

...

if (compatUtils.isCompatEnabled('INSTANCE_LISTENERS')) {
    return this.$listeners;
}

return {};

...
```


Important: the test still runs also with compat mode activated in parallel."

In some instances, a system rollout was completed where an error in certain system functionalities was not detected until the system was live.

A software system is made up of many components that work together to provide a service. The software system can still be healthy even if some of its components are not fully in a healthy state.  System health checks are a way to monitor the health of a system and detect failures early.","## Decision

To improve early detection of errors during system rollouts, we will implement comprehensive, component-level health checks that run continuously in pre-production and production environments. These health checks will monitor each critical component's status independently, allowing us to detect partial failures even when the overall system appears healthy. 

Additionally, we will integrate automated validation tests that exercise key functionalities during deployment processes, ensuring that errors are caught before the system is fully live. By combining detailed health monitoring with automated rollout validations, we can detect and address faults early, minimizing the impact of errors discovered post-deployment.","## Decision

We will implement system health checks in Shopware to monitor certain parts of the system with the aim to detect failures and issues early.
This system should be extensible and allow for custom health checks to be added with ease."

To ensure that the major feature flag is only enabled during unit tests within the `Shopware\Tests\Unit` namespace, we will retain the current implementation of the `TestPreparationStartedSubscriber`. This subscriber will continue to restrict the feature flag activation exclusively to the `Shopware\Tests\Unit` namespace during the PHPUnit test preparation phase. By doing so, we maintain isolation of the feature flag to the intended test scope, preventing unintended side effects in other test suites or namespaces.","## Decision

To be able to unit test the upcoming major feature in other plugins we will enable the possibility to add other
namespaces to
the `Shopware\Core\Test\PHPUnit\Extension\FeatureFlag\Subscriber\TestPreparationStartedSubscriber`.

We'll add a static method called `addNamespace()` method to the
`Shopware\Core\Test\PHPUnit\Extension\FeatureFlag\FeatureFlagExtension` and by this we are able to add other namespaces
to the allowlist of the namespaces to be considered when enabling the major flags in the unit test suite.

This can be useful for plugins that wants to enable the major flags in their unit tests suite.

Therefore, add the extension to the extension list in the `phpunit.xml`:

```xml

<extensions>
    ...
    <bootstrap class=""Shopware\Core\Test\PHPUnit\Extension\FeatureFlag\FeatureFlagExtension""/>
</extensions>

And register your test namespace in your test bootstrap file:

```php
FeatureFlagExtension::addTestNamespace('Your\\Unit\\Tests\\Namespace\\');

For example, in the Commercial plugin, we added the following code to the `tests/TestBootstrap.php` file:

```php
FeatureFlagExtension::addTestNamespace('Shopware\\Commercial\\Tests\\Unit\\');

Our Vue.js application currently uses the Options API, which is the traditional way of writing Vue components in Vue 2. With the release of Vue 3, the Composition API was introduced, offering improved code organization, better TypeScript support, and enhanced reusability of component logic.

To modernize our codebase and take advantage of these benefits, we need to migrate our existing Vue 2 Options API components to use the Vue 3 Composition API. Manual conversion of numerous components would be time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, we need an automated solution to assist in this migration process.","## Decision

We will adopt an automated migration tool to convert our existing Vue 2 Options API components to Vue 3 Composition API syntax. This tool will parse and transform component code, minimizing manual effort and reducing the risk of errors during migration.

By leveraging automation, we aim to accelerate the upgrade while maintaining code quality and consistency throughout the codebase.","## Decision

We have decided to implement a Codemod in the form of an ESLint rule to automatically convert Vue 2 Options API components to Vue 3 Composition API. This Codemod will:

1. Identify Vue component definitions in the codebase.
2. Convert the following Options API features to their Composition API equivalents:
    - Convert `data` properties to `ref` or `reactive`.
    - Convert `computed` properties to `computed()` functions.
    - Convert `methods` to regular functions within the `setup()` function.
    - Convert lifecycle hooks to their Composition API equivalents (e.g., `mounted` to `onMounted`).
    - Convert Vue 2 specific lifecycle hooks to their Vue 3 equivalents.
    - Convert `watch` properties to `watch()` functions.
    - Handle `props` and `inject` conversions.
    - Replace `this` references with direct references to reactive variables.
    - Convert writable computed properties.
    - Handle reactive object reassignments using `Object.assign`
    - Handle correct usage of `ref` and replace the access to the value with `.value`.

3. Generate a `setup()` function containing the converted code.
4. Add necessary imports for Composition API functions (e.g., `ref`, `reactive`, `computed`, `watch`).

The Codemod will be implemented as an ESLint rule to leverage the existing ESLint ecosystem and allow for easy integration into our development workflow."

Moving blocks from TwigJs to Vue.js creates consistency in the technology stack, simplifying development and reducing the cognitive load on developers who previously had to switch between TwigJs and Vue.js.

2. **Improved Flexibility**: With Vue.js blocks we have control over the provided access to the componentÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂ¯s internals, allowing for more granular control over block behavior and content. This allows us to create a public API for any component, making it easier to extend and modify internal behavior, without breaking the public API."

We will replace the asterisk `*` next to product prices with a tooltip icon or a hover-over info indicator that explicitly explains the tax and shipping cost details.

Specifically, the following changes will be made:
- Remove the asterisk `*` from all product price labels.
- Add a small information icon (e.g., an ""i"" in a circle) next to the price.
- On hover or tap of this icon, display a tooltip or popover that reads: ""All prices include VAT plus shipping costs and possible delivery charges, if not stated otherwise.""
- Ensure the footer note is either simplified or removed to avoid redundancy.

This decision improves user experience by making the cost information more discoverable and less visually intrusive, aligning with modern UI/UX best practices.","## Decision

The asterisk `*` next to every price will be removed because of the reasons mentioned above.

If technical constraints or licensing costs of PrinceXML present challenges, we will explore open-source alternatives such as PDFTron or wkhtmltopdf with accessibility plugins, ensuring accessibility remains the priority.

- **Lack of Support**: As our current PDFs lack support for accessibility. Few tools, especially in PHP, can create accessible tagged PDFs, making it difficult to maintain PDF accessibility.

- **Industry Trends**: Many organizations are already moving from PDFs to HTML for accessibility. For example, government websites have been required to meet accessibility standards since the early 2000s. Most of them now use HTML for most of their content because it meets these standards better.

Providing HTML documents aligns with these trends and ensures we are using best practices for accessibility."

The existing rule system is flexible but complex, making it difficult to evolve and maintain. Allowing unrestricted extensions of rule classes slows down improvements and increases the complexity of the system.

See RFC: https://github.com/shopware/shopware/discussions/5785","## Decision

We will introduce a well-defined extension mechanism for the rule system that restricts arbitrary subclassing of rule classes. Instead of allowing unrestricted creation of new rule subclasses, we will establish a plugin-based or configuration-driven approach where new rules can be added through registered handlers or factories adhering to a stable interface.

This approach will:

- Reduce complexity by limiting direct subclassing
- Enable easier maintenance and evolution of the rule system
- Allow controlled extensibility through clear extension points
- Foster consistency and predictability in how rules are defined and integrated

We will document the extension guidelines and provide tooling support to assist developers in implementing new rules within the approved framework.","## Decision
We will mark existing rule classes as internal, limiting direct usage by third parties. Developers should create new rule classes instead of modifying existing ones. 

Nearly all rule classes will be marked as internal, with a few exceptions: 

```
LineItemOfTypeRule
LineItemProductStatesRule
PromotionCodeOfTypeRule
ZipCodeRule
BillingZipCodeRule
ShippingZipCodeRule
```

These classes will remain public for now, because they rely on configuration which is reasonably expected to be extended by third-party developers."
"## Context

The Storefront JavaScript currently offers a helper class `src/helper/iterator.helper.js` that can iterate over different objects like Maps, FormData, plain arrays etc.
Using this approach has several downsides we want to address.

* It creates an unnecessary abstraction over the native alternative. Very often the `Iterator.iterate()` directly uses js plain `forEach` loop without any additional logic. Using the abstraction is actually creating more complexity.
* It prevents the developer from using the appropriate loop for the given data type and instead passes it to an iterator that does it with arbitrary data types.
* The iterator is a special shopware syntax that needs to be understood and documented. It is way easier to use web standards that everyone knows and that is also officially documented already.
* The usage throughout the codebase is inconsistent and the iterator helper is used alongside the native loops which can create confusion.
* It creates the impression that the data that is being iterated is some special custom object that needs a special iterator helper. In reality, it is a simple `NodeList` in 90% of the time.
* It creates an additional dependency/import in every file that is using it.","## Decision

We will deprecate and remove the `src/helper/iterator.helper.js` abstraction and refactor the codebase to use native JavaScript iteration methods consistently. From now on, developers should use standard iterations such as `forEach`, `for...of` loops, or other appropriate native loops depending on the data structure (e.g., `for...of` for arrays and NodeLists, `for...of` or `for...of` with `.entries()` for Maps, etc.).

This decision aligns with web standards, reduces complexity and cognitive overhead, improves code readability and consistency across the codebase, and eliminates unnecessary dependencies and imports. Documentation and developer guidelines will be updated to reflect and encourage this native iteration practice.","## Decision

For all the above reasons we have decided to deprecate `src/helper/iterator.helper.js`, stop using it, and use native alternatives instead.
We want to have a more lean and simple Storefront JavaScript that needs less special things to learn and understand."
"## Context

Currently, flows are executed during the business process. A business
process is any event that is triggered by the user, like a checkout or
a product update. Flows are used to react to these events and execute user defined actions.

There are several downsides to this approach. The most straightforward is the possibility of a fatal error during
the execution of any flow. This will inevitably cancel the in progress business process. While there are remedies in place
to avoid any trivial errors in flow execution disrupting the business process, certain errors can not be avoided.

Further, even if all flows execute without error, they noticeably impact business process performance. Flows are often 
employed to, for example, send mails, an expensive operation that is not necessary to complete the business process.

In addition to these concrete disadvantages, there are also some more abstract ones. For one, currently flows are executed directly
from a decorator of Symfony's `EventDispatcher`, leading to cumbersome debugging and bloated stack traces. This would
be improved if flows are executed by a dedicated event listener. Additionally moving flows to their own execution
environment would not only simplify debugging, but also potentially make expanding their capabilities easier.

> *The following is all experimental and only takes effect if the associated feature flag `FLOW_EXECUTION_AFTER_BUSINESS_PROCESS` is enabled*","# Decision

Flows will be executed asynchronously after the business process completes successfully, triggered by a dedicated event listener rather than directly during the business process execution or from an EventDispatcher decorator. This behavior will be controlled by a feature flag `FLOW_EXECUTION_AFTER_BUSINESS_PROCESS` to allow gradual adoption and experimentation.

# Rationale

- Executing flows after the business process avoids the risk of fatal errors in flows terminating or rolling back the main business operation.
- Decoupling flow execution improves performance of the business process by avoiding expensive or non-essential operations like email sending from blocking core activities.
- Using a dedicated event listener for flow execution simplifies debugging by reducing stack trace complexity and separating concerns.
- Running flows in their own execution environment facilitates easier extension, improved isolation, and error handling.
- A feature flag allows incremental rollout and validation of this approach without disrupting existing behavior.

# Implications

- Business processes become more robust and performant since flows no longer block or interfere directly.
- Flow execution errors won't impact the main process but must be monitored separately.
- Developers need to adapt to new debugging and tracing patterns for flows.
- Eventually, all flow execution can migrate to asynchronous handling, paving the way for further enhancements.","## Decision


We will move the flow execution after the business process. As outlined above we believe that this will simplify the
development around flows, while also improving their performance and safeguarding the main execution environment.

To ensure that flows are executed as close to the business process that triggered them as possible, we will
'queue' the flow execution. This means that flows will be executed after the business process has finished.
Flows are stored in memory and executed as soon as the execution environment signals, that it has
finished a unit of work. The associated events are as follows:

1. After a controller action has been executed (Web) => `KernelEvents::TERMINATE`
2. After a queued message has been processed (Queue) => `WorkerMessageHandledEvent`
3. After a command has been executed (CLI) => `ConsoleEvents::TERMINATE`

Another option would be to handle flow executions as queue messages. This would entirely remove
flow executions from the runtime of the business process. While this would be a simpler solution,
it would both make debugging more complex and introduce an unpredictable delay between the business
process and the flow execution. While this delay could be mitigated by using a high priority queue,
it could not reliably be kept under a certain threshold. To entirely avoid this delay, we decided
that the flow execution should be handled as close to the business process as possible."
"## Context and Problem Statement

We want to record architectural decisions made in this project.
Which format and structure should these records follow?","## Decision

We will adopt the widely recognized Architectural Decision Record (ADR) format as popularized by Michael Nygard. Each ADR will be a plain text or markdown file that captures the key elements of the decision making process, including context, decision, status, consequences, and alternatives considered. This structure ensures clarity, consistency, and ease of maintenance. The ADR files will be stored in a dedicated directory within the project repository (e.g., `/docs/adr/`) to keep them organized and easily accessible for future reference.","## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: ""MADR 2.1.2"", because

* Implicit assumptions should be made explicit.
  Design documentation is important to enable people understanding the decisions
  later on.
* The MADR structure is comprehensible and facilitates usage & maintenance."
"## Context and Problem Statement

The Metadata API provides a modern Python API for accessing individual pieces
of metadata. It does not provide any wider context help to someone looking to
implement a TUF repository.

The legacy python-tuf implementation offers tools for this but suffers from
some issues (as do many other implementations):
* There is a _very_ large amount of code to maintain: repo.py,
  repository_tool.py and repository_lib.py alone are almost 7000 lines of code.
* The ""library like"" parts of the implementation do not form a good coherent
  API: methods routinely have a large number of arguments, code still depends
  on globals in a major way and application (repo.py) still implements a lot of
  ""repository code"" itself
* The ""library like"" parts of the implementation make decisions that look like
  application decisions. As an example, repository_tool loads _every_ metadata
  file in the repository: this is fine for CLI that operates on a small
  repository but is unlikely to be a good choice for a large scale server.","## Decision

We will design and implement a new, coherent, and modular repository management library for TUF in Python that builds on top of the modern Metadata API. This new library will encapsulate repository logic and workflows in a clear, well-structured API, avoiding the pitfalls of the legacy codebase by:

- Minimizing code duplication and reducing overall code size through modular design and clear separation of concerns.
- Providing concise, explicit method interfaces with well-defined arguments to replace sprawling functions relying on globals.
- Avoiding assumptions about application-specific behavior within the library, instead exposing flexible hooks or configuration options that allow diverse usage patterns (e.g., loading metadata files on-demand rather than all at once).
- Clearly distinguishing between library-level repository manipulation and application-level concerns, enabling reuse across different tools and contexts with better maintainability and scalability.

This approach will improve developer experience, facilitate large-scale server implementations, and enable better long-term maintenance of the TUF repository tooling ecosystem.","## Decision Drivers

* There is a consensus on removing the legacy code from python-tuf due to
  maintainability issues
* Metadata API makes modifying metadata far easier than legacy code base: this
  makes significantly different designs possible
* Not providing a ""repository library"" (and leaving implementers on their own)
  may be a short term solution because of the previous point, but to make
  adoption easier and to help adopters create safe implementations the project
  would benefit from some shared repository code and a shared repository design 
* Maintainability of new library code must be a top concern
* Allowing a wide range of repository implementations (from CLI tools to
  minimal in-memory implementations to large scale application servers)
  would be good: unfortunately these can have wildly differing requirements"

Primer React components was originally released without TypeScript type definitions, making it difficult for engineers to consume the library in TypeScript applications. In [July 2019](https://github.com/primer/react/commit/2983c935ea9ad600c04078adb25e40c3624c11fa#diff-7aa4473ede4abd9ec099e87fec67fd57afafaf39e05d493ab4533acc38547eb8), we created an [ambient declaration](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/typescript-ambients-declaration/) file (`index.d.ts`) file to provide type definitions for TypeScript applications without having to rewrite Primer React components in TypeScript.

`index.d.ts` has been an effective stopgap, enabling teams to build complex applications with Primer React components and TypeScript. However, because `index.d.ts` is disconnected from the implementation code, we've struggled to keep the type definitions up-to-date and accurate, as evidenced by [many](https://github.com/primer/react/issues/906) [TypeScript](https://github.com/primer/react/issues/540) [bug](https://github.com/primer/react/issues/520) [reports](https://github.com/primer/react/issues/534). As the library continues to grow in size and complexity, manually maintaining type definitions will become unsustainable.","## Decision

We will migrate Primer React components from JavaScript with separate ambient TypeScript declarations to full TypeScript implementation. This means rewriting the component source code in TypeScript and co-locating type definitions with the implementation. By doing so, type definitions will remain accurate and synchronized with the codebase, reducing TypeScript-related bugs and improving developer experience for consumers of the library. Additionally, this migration will enable better editor support and easier maintenance as the library evolves.","## Decision

We will rewrite Primer React components in TypeScript."
"## Context

In Primer React and consuming applications, we use many different patterns for creating React components. Two common patterns are:

1. Creating components with styled-components

   ```tsx
   const Avatar = styled.img.attrs<StyledAvatarProps>(props => ({
     height: props.size,
     width: props.size,
   }))<StyledAvatarProps>`
     display: inline-block;
     overflow: hidden;
     line-height: ${get('lineHeights.condensedUltra')};
     border-radius: ${props => getBorderRadius(props)};
     ${sx}
   `
   ```

   [Show full code example ÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂº](https://github.com/primer/react/pull/2019/files?diff=split&w=0)

2. Creating components with Box

   ```tsx
   const Avatar: React.FC<AvatarProps> = ({size = 20, alt = '', square = false, sx = {}, ...props}) => {
     const styles: BetterSystemStyleObject = {
       display: 'inline-block',
       overflow: 'hidden',
       lineHeight: 'condensedUltra',
       borderRadius: getBorderRadius({size, square}),
     }

     return (
       <Box
         as=""img""
         alt={alt}
         sx={merge<BetterSystemStyleObject>(styles, sx)} // styles needs to merge with props.sx
         {...props}
       />
     )
   }
   ```

   [Show full code example ÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂº](https://github.com/primer/react/pull/2019/files?diff=split&w=0)

&nbsp;","## Decision

We will standardize on using the Box component pattern for creating React components in Primer React and consuming applications.

### Rationale

- **Consistency:** Using Box provides a single consistent method for styling components across the codebase.

- **Flexibility:** Box allows for dynamic merging of styles via the `sx` prop, enabling easier style overrides and theming without the constraints of styled-components syntax.

- **Performance:** Box components leverage the underlying system efficiently, potentially resulting in better runtime performance and easier debugging.

- **Developer Experience:** Using Box keeps the component code straightforward and declarative, enabling clearer separation between styles and markup.

- **Maintainability:** Consolidating on Box reduces maintenance overhead by avoiding multiple styling paradigms and simplifies onboarding for new contributors.

This decision promotes a unified, flexible, and maintainable approach to building components in our React ecosystem.","## Decision

Prefer using method #2: Creating components with Box for the following reasons:

- Better authoring experience with Typescript. With Box, we can improve the API and autocomplete for consuming primitives. [See research](https://github.com/github/primer/discussions/755#discussioncomment-2318144)
- The styling library (i.e. styled-components) becomes an implementation detail and can be changed later with minimal breaking changes for consumers. (Avoids leaky abstractions)
- We have had issues with exporting types, we can increase confidence by keeping the exported types close to what we author.

"## Context

`Drafts` were introduced in [ADR-006](./adrs/adr-006-drafts.md) as a way of creating components outside of the root bundle of `@primer/react`. This helps us create, test and maintain multiple versions of the same component in parallel.

Example:

```js
// default version of component exported from root of package
import {UnderlineNav} from '@primer/react'

// new version of component exported from /drafts
import {UnderlineNav} from '@primer/react/drafts'
```

We have also used this method for components that are still a work in progress and we don't want developers to start using them in production without collaborating with us first.

Example:

```js
// this component only exists in drafts and not in the roof of the package
import {TreeView} from '@primer/react/drafts'
```","## Decision

We will continue using the `drafts` folder and the `@primer/react/drafts` import path pattern to isolate components that are experimental, under active development, or represent new versions of existing components. This approach allows us to:

- Maintain multiple component versions in parallel without impacting the stable public API.
- Enable developers to test and iterate on new designs and APIs without prematurely exposing them as stable.
- Clearly communicate the stability and readiness of components via their import path, discouraging production use of unstable components.
- Simplify migration and adoption by allowing opt-in usage of draft components.

We will maintain documentation and guidelines encouraging use of the draft import for experimental components and tracking promotion of these components into the main package exports once they are stable and ready for production. This strategy balances innovation and stability, streamlining component evolution within the `@primer/react` library.","## Decision

We should drop the `draft` label and use `experimental` instead.

While not completely accurate (UnderlineNav2 is much more polished than `experimental` maturity), the lack of confusion makes it a good trade-off.

Fine-grained information about component maturity, useful for maintainers, is also communicated by the [status checklist in the component documentation](https://primer.style/react/drafts/UnderlineNav2#status)."
"## Context

[Snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing) is a strategy that allows a developer to ""snapshot"" a given value within a test suite. This value could be a primitive within JavaScript, an Array, an object, or the resulting HTML of rendering a component in React. The snapshot of the value is stored within the repo and is then compared against future test runs.

When a change is detected to a snapshot, the test will fail with a diff between the currently stored snapshot and the new snapshot. Within the space of React components, this may happen when a class name changes or the markup of a component changes. Is is then up to the developer to decide if the change is intentional and whether or not to accept this new snapshot as the baseline for future test runs.

A common practice is to snapshot a React component which will capture the HTML output of rendering a component. For example:

```jsx
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer'
import Link from '../Link'

it('renders correctly', () => {
  const tree = renderer.create(<Link page=""http://www.facebook.com"">Facebook</Link>).toJSON()
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot()
})
```

```js
exports[`renders correctly 1`] = `
<a
  className=""normal""
  href=""http://www.facebook.com""
  onMouseEnter={[Function]}
  onMouseLeave={[Function]}
>
  Facebook
</a>
`
```

[Source](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing#snapshot-testing-with-jest)

As the number of snapshots within a project grows, there are a couple of challenges that emerge:

- Components with wide or deep trees emit large snapshots
- Debugging what change lead to a broken snapshot can be difficult
- It is unclear what the intent may be of a snapshot test when something does fail, in other words it does not always answer the question: what is this testing?","## Decision

We will adopt a modular snapshot testing strategy, focusing snapshots on smaller, meaningful pieces of the UI rather than capturing entire deep component trees. This approach includes:

- Snapshotting shallow-rendered components or isolated subcomponents instead of full DOM trees, to keep snapshot sizes manageable and focused.
- Writing descriptive test names and using comments to clarify the intent of each snapshot, so that when changes occur the reason for the snapshot is clear.
- Combining snapshot tests with targeted unit and integration tests that validate specific component behaviors alongside the snapshots that capture UI output.
- Reviewing and pruning snapshots regularly to remove outdated or redundant snapshots to maintain clarity and usefulness.
- Using custom serializers where appropriate to produce cleaner, more readable snapshots that reduce noise from insignificant changes.

This decision balances the benefits of snapshot testing — automated UI regression monitoring — while mitigating challenges of large, unwieldy snapshots and ambiguous test intent, thus improving maintainability and developer trust in the tests.","## Decision

- Avoid using ""catch-all"" snapshot tests for React components
- Snapshots may be used for static objects which have a clear signal as to what to do if they are modified (such as the exports of a package)

There are situations where we would like to provide warnings to developers who
use `@primer/react` that something may be deprecated, unsupported, etc. Often,
these will be emitted using `console.warn()`. When using `console.warn()` by
itself, we run into a situation where code that is only meant for development
is included in production code. As a result, it would be helpful to establish
patterns around how to provide warnings to developers in order to make sure
that:

- Calls to `console.warn()` do not appear in production
- Code related to development checks, warnings, or messages are removed from
  production code","## Decision

To ensure development-only warnings do not appear in production code, we will adopt a controlled warning mechanism using a feature-flagged logging utility. Specifically:

- Create a centralized warning utility module, e.g., `warn.ts`, which exports a `warn()` function.
- The `warn()` function will check a compile-time environment variable, such as `process.env.NODE_ENV`, and will issue warnings only if running in development mode (`NODE_ENV !== 'production'`).
- During the build process, use dead code elimination tools (e.g., Terser or Babel plugin) that remove the warning calls entirely from the production bundle.
- Developers will be encouraged to always use this `warn()` utility instead of calling `console.warn()` directly.
- Document this pattern as part of the developer guidelines to avoid direct use of `console.warn()` in favor of the warning utility.
  
This approach ensures that:

- Warnings are visible during development to aid developers.
- No warning-related code remains in production bundles, leading to smaller and cleaner production code.
- Consistency is maintained across the codebase regarding how warnings are issued.","## Decision

Code that is meant for development-only warnings or checks **must** be wrapped within a
`__DEV__` block.

```tsx
function ExampleComponent() {
  if (__DEV__) {
    // This code only runs in development
  }
}
```

Under-the-hood, the `__DEV__` block will be compiled to a `NODE_ENV` check so
that it is stripped when `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`.

> **Note**
> Contributors may wrap hooks within a `__DEV__` block even though hooks are not
> meant to be called conditionally. This is because the `__DEV__` check can be
> considered constant in that it will always be true or false for the
> environment (development or production).

When a contributor would like to communicate a warning to a developer, they
should use the `warning()` helper.

```ts
warning(condition, 'This is the message that is logged when condition is truth-y')
```

This helper allows you to provide a `condition`. When the condition is truth-y
it will emit the message provided. This helper is automatically wrapped in a
`__DEV__` block and will be removed from production builds.

For more complex conditions, a contributor may combine `console.warn()` with
`__DEV__` when `warning()` does not suffice."
"## Context

There are several components in Primer React that make use of live regions.
However, the library does not have a central pattern for making accessible live
region announcements. This ADR documents the decision to use a central pattern
for live region announcements that can be used across Primer and GitHub.

ARIA Live regions fall into several buckets that we may want to use as component
authors:

- [ARIA live region roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#live_region_roles), such as `alert`, `log`, or `status`
- [The `aria-live` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-live) to turn an element into a live region

In components, we see the following scenarios in Primer React:

- Announce the contents of an element when it is rendered or on page load, like when a spinner is displayed or a form is submitted
- Announce the changes to the content of an element, like when the count inside of a
  button is incremented
- Announce a message programmatically, such as the number of results for a query

Currently, contributors may reach for roles such as `alert` or `status` to
achieve these scenarios. They may also add `aria-live=""assertive""` or `aria-live=""polite""` with an an `aria-atomic=""true""` to an element explicitly.
However, both of these approaches do not announce consistently across screen
readers. This could be due to live regions being injected dynamically into the document (this includes loading content into the document via React), dynamically changing the visibility of a live region, or some other technique causing an announcement to not be announced.

For more information about the ways in which live regions may not work as
expected, visit: [Why are my live regions not working?](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2024/05/01/why-are-my-live-regions-not-working/)","## Decision

We will implement a centralized live region management utility within Primer React that provides a consistent API for announcing messages to screen readers. This utility will abstract the details of live region creation and management, ensuring reliable announcements across different screen readers and usage scenarios.

Key aspects of the decision include:

- **Dedicated Live Region Containers**: Create persistent, visually hidden DOM elements for each ARIA live region type (`assertive`, `polite`, and potentially others like `log`) at the root level of the application or component tree. These containers will remain mounted, avoiding issues caused by dynamic injection or removal.

- **Programmatic Announcement API**: Expose a simple, imperative API (e.g., `announce(message: string, mode: 'assertive' | 'polite')`) that components can call to announce messages without managing DOM changes or ARIA attributes themselves.

- **Atomic Updates and Debouncing**: Ensure announcements include proper `aria-atomic` handling and debounce rapid successive announcements to prevent announcement clashes or missed updates.

- **Support for Multiple Use Cases**: Cover common scenarios such as announcing content changes on render, updates to counters, and programmatic messages across components.

By adopting this centralized approach, we standardize live region usage, improve accessibility consistency, simplify contributor experience, and align with best practices outlined in accessibility guidance and recent research on live region behavior.","## Decision

In order to have a common interop point for live region announcements, Primer React will
make use of a `live-region` custom element from `@primer/live-region-element`.
This package will be included and published from the `primer/react` repo.

The custom element exposes a way to make announcements that can be used
across frameworks. This makes it useful not only for Primer but GitHub as a
whole. The `@primer/live-region-element` exports two helpers to use for making
announcements: `announce()` and `announceFromElement`. Both helpers can be used
when working in Primer and by teams at GitHub.

In addition, `@primer/react` will leverage and export the following helpers for
use within Primer React and GitHub:

- The `AriaStatus` component to correspond with `role=""status""`
- The `AriaAlert` component to correspond with `role=""alert""`

Within `@primer/react`, we should lint against usage of `aria-live` and the
corresponding roles (if possible) and suggest using these alternatives instead.

> [!NOTE]
> Both `AriaStatus` and `AriaAlert` will trigger an announcement when the component is
> rendered. As a result, they should only be used for dynamically rendered
> content. Otherwise, they will trigger announcements on page load. In cases
> where they should always be present, then the first message passed to the
> component should be an empty string. Changes to the content of the component
> will trigger subsequent announcements."
## Context,"## Decision

Given the absence of specific contextual information, the decision is to gather detailed requirements and context before proceeding with architectural decisions. This ensures that the architecture aligns with the project's goals, constraints, and environment. Once sufficient context is obtained, a tailored architectural decision can be made accordingly.","## Decision

1. npm package: ""Experimental"" components, as defined by the component lifecycle, should not be part of semantically versioned npm package for `@primer/react`.

2. npm package: Each experimental component should be independently published and versioned with semver. Breaking changes should be tagged as major versions. Example: `@github/experimental-react-commentbox`

3. The code for experimental components should live in a new repository, example: [github/react-experimental](https://github.com/github/react-experimental) and published as individual packages as suggested in point 2.

This will help in sharing experimental components between the monolith and projects outside of monolith. The ownership and responsibility of maintenance will be shared by multiple teams (including primer)."
"## Context

Our testing infrastructure consists of Jest ""unit"" tests and automatic Chromatic visual testing. Both of these are super useful but we have been experiencing a few setbacks.
Unofficially we test more complex interactive scenarios using our storybooks setup.

1. Repeated markup in storybooks and jest tests - Since there is not automation of interaction in storybooks, we tend to test them out manually in stories and then transfer to jest. This results in us constructing similar test case scenarios in storybooks and in tests.

2. Debugging complex jest tests - There is no visual aspect to jest tests. Mostly everything is CLI based. This makes it hard to debug broken tests. Visibility into these tests is also low for people who want to enhance them.","## Decision

To address the overlap and visibility issues in our testing strategy, we will adopt a unified testing approach by integrating interaction testing directly within Storybook using the Storybook Testing Library and Interaction Addon. This enables us to write interaction tests alongside stories, leveraging Storybook’s visual interface for easier debugging and review. Jest tests will then focus on purely logic-driven units without UI interaction duplication.

Key points of the decision:

- Use Storybook's interaction testing capabilities to automate user interactions within stories, reducing repetition and manual transfer of test scenarios.
- Leverage Storybook’s visual environment to improve visibility and debugging of UI interactions, making tests more accessible to all team members.
- Continue using Jest primarily for non-UI logic and utility tests, keeping it lean and focused.
- Integrate Chromatic visual testing to continue validating UI regressions, complementing the interaction tests in Storybook.

This approach reduces maintenance overhead, enhances test clarity and debugging capability, and aligns our testing practices with the strengths of each tool.","## Decisions

Going forward, we can use [storybook's play functions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function) to write interaction tests for our components. Here's a document that describes [how to add and run these tests](../storybook-tests.md).
Guidelines to make this easier -

1. Create a new storybook file for your components and call them ""interactions"". Inside these files, we can import the stories from ""examples"" or ""fixtures"" and tack on play functions to them. This will create duplicate stories but with the added benefit of the tests appearing in the interactions add-on tab. This tab will let you step through your tests step by step, increasing visibility and debuggability.

2. Port complex jest tests onto interactive tests. This is up to developer discretion. My recommendation is to have basic ""unit"" tests like component existence and axe tests in jest. Anything that can benefit from a visual aspect to it can be moved to interaction tests.

3. Interaction tests are not perfect. Some aspects like mocking can be challenging and we will find solutions to these as when the need arises."

> We have workspaces within the project but no official way of connecting them or managing dependencies from the top-level. Similarly, scripts that grow in size or complexity have no dedicated home or ability to manage dependencies outside of the top-level workspace.

The `primer/react` repo is composed of several workspaces that use `npm` to manage dependencies. In order to install these dependencies, a contributor needs to visit each directory and run `npm install`. The project also has a convenience script for this task, invoked through `npm run setup`, that goes through this process for contributors.

These distinct workspaces may sometimes depend on each other. For example, the `docs` workspace depends on the `@primer/react` package which is defined at the top-level of the project. Similarly, examples in the `examples/*` folders may also depend on `@primer/react`. Currently these dependencies are expressed either through relative paths, file dependencies in `package.json`, or symlinks through `npm link`.

There is also a collection of scripts under the `script` directory that exist in the project that involve varying levels of complexity and depth.","## Decision

We will adopt a centralized dependency management strategy using a monorepo tool such as `npm workspaces` to unify the installation and linking of all workspaces in the repository. This means defining all workspaces explicitly in the top-level `package.json` under the `workspaces` field. Contributors will be able to run a single `npm install` at the project root, which will install all dependencies and correctly link inter-workspace dependencies automatically.

To manage scripts with dependencies outside the top-level workspace, we will either:

- Organize these scripts into their own dedicated workspace with a `package.json` to manage their dependencies formally; or
- Convert more complex scripts into reusable packages that can be versioned and depended upon by other workspaces in the monorepo.

This approach ensures that dependency management is consistent, straightforward, and scalable as the project grows, while improving developer experience by reducing manual steps and avoiding brittle relative paths or symlinks.","## Decision

Setup the project to use [`npm` workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces). This will require changing the project to have a top-level `package.json` file which will use `workspaces` to reference child workspaces. The layout for the project would then be:

```
- root
  # Root package.json, defines workspaces
  - package.json

  # Workspaces
  - docs
  - packages
    - react
    - *
  - examples
    - nextjs
    - consumer-test
    - *

  # Top-level scripts
  - script

  # Testing & Development
  - .storybook
  - .playwright

  # Repo config
  - .github
  - .vscode
```

The following items will be installed and ran at the root-level:

- Linting
  - `eslint`
  - `markdownlint`
- Testing
  - Jest
  - Playwright
- Development
  - Storybook
- Type checking
  - TypeScript

Certain configuration items, like for TypeScript or Babel, may need configuration defined at the top-level and extended by child workspaces.

The current `@primer/react` package will move to the `packages/react` package. Workspaces that depend on `@primer/react` should reference the version of that package."
"## Context

Currently all files live under the `src` directory. In the `npm` package for `@primer/react`, we specify the following export pattern:

```json5
{
  exports: {
    // ...
    './lib-esm/*': {
      import: [
        // ...
      ],
      require: [
        // ...
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

This pattern, along with our Rollup setup, opts-in files and folders under the `src` directory into the public API of the package. This means that certain parts of the codebase which aren't intended to be used outside of `@primer/react` are considered part of its public API and can be imported and used by consumers.","# Decision

We will restructure the project directory to clearly separate public API source code from internal implementation details by introducing a dedicated `src/public` directory (or similarly named, e.g. `src/lib`) that contains all files and modules meant for public consumption. Only the code placed in this directory will be explicitly exported and bundled in the `lib-esm` export pattern of the package.

This entails:

- Moving all public-facing modules currently mixed in the `src` directory into `src/public`.
- Configuring Rollup and the package `exports` field to only include files under `src/public` in the published API surface.
- Placing internal-only code, utilities, and implementation details outside `src/public` (e.g., in `src/internal` or `src/utils`), making clear their non-public status and preventing accidental consumption by downstream users.
- Updating documentation and developer guidelines to enforce the use of the `src/public` folder for all public exports.

This separation establishes a clear boundary between public API and internal code, improving maintainability, preventing API surface creep, and enabling safer refactoring without breaking consumers.","## Decision

Adopt a convention in Primer React where internal modules live in the `src/internal` folder. This folder which would include all components, hooks, and other modules which are not intended for usage outside of the project. Files within `src/internal` may be grouped by area, such as `src/internal/components`, `src/internal/hooks`, etc.

In the `""exports""` field of our `npm` package, we can then add the following pattern:

```json5
{
  exports: {
    // ...
    './lib-esm/internal/*': null,
  },
}
```

This pattern would remove any files and folders within `src/internal` from the public API of the `npm` package. This pattern is inspired by [this section](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#package-entry-points) from Node.js, specifically this example:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""my-package"",
  ""exports"": {
    ""."": ""./lib/index.js"",
    ""./feature/*.js"": ""./feature/*.js"",
    ""./feature/internal/*"": null
  }
}
```"

Reasons for change: Performance, utilise css variables

The main reason for changing our styling architecture is to remove performance issues for applications:

Relevant parts from [primer/discussions#1928](https://github.com/github/primer/discussions/1928#reasons)(Hubbers only link):

1. Initial page loads take longer

   Because styles are injected during runtime, we can not parallelize this work. The page is un-styled till the javascript bundle is
   downloaded and processed. The processing time is longer on slower devices.

   Benchmarks:

   i. Lab benchmarks: rendering a page with 1000 components
   runtime injection of css: 242ms
   static .css files: 96ms (60% faster)

   ii. Application benchmarks: render times for repo directory (>1000 files, [gh/gh#241090](https://github.com/github/github/pull/241090))
   with primer/react Box: 3800ms
   with custom css: 3076ms (20% faster)

2. Slow server side rendering

   Some applications are able to make up for slower initial render times by collecting styles on the server first. In the correct stack, collecting styles requires rendering the app twice before we can ship any html to the user.

   benchmarks: in the issues-app experiment, collecting styles on the server contributed to + 20% of rendering time (450ms on top of 1900ms)

3. Style updates are expensive

   The slowest part of the current stack is updating styles based on props or state. Big changes take linearly longer, worse on slower devices.

   Benchmarks:

   i. Lab benchmarks: updating a page with 1000 components, static runtime css vs. dynamic runtime css (thanks @mattcosta7 for these!)

   re-rendering components with fixed styles on runtime: 242ms
   re-rendering components with dynamic styles on runtime: 441ms (55% slower)

   ii. Application benchmarks: opting out of IconButton for PR diff view (>500 files, [gh/gh#243269](https://github.com/github/github/pull/243269))

   dynamic styles with sx prop: 400ms
   dynamic styles with .css files: 165ms (60% faster)

The other reasons for change are to utilise css variables for theming and improve the guardrails of consuming primer/primitives","## Decision

We will migrate from runtime-injected dynamic styles to a static CSS architecture that leverages CSS variables for theming.

### Rationale

- **Performance Improvements:** Static CSS files load and render significantly faster than styles injected during runtime, reducing initial page load time by up to 60% and improving re-render performance by over 50% in benchmark scenarios.
- **Server-Side Rendering Efficiency:** Avoiding runtime style collection on the server eliminates the need for double rendering, cutting server render times by approximately 20%.
- **Theming with CSS Variables:** Adopting CSS variables enables performant, dynamic theming without expensive style recalculations or runtime injection.
- **Better Guardrails:** Moving styling to static CSS with defined CSS variables improves type safety, consistency, and maintainability for consumers of primer/primitives.

### Implementation Outline

- Extract reusable style rules into static CSS files, using CSS variables to represent dynamic design tokens.
- Refactor components to use class names and CSS variables rather than inline styles or runtime-generated styles.
- Ensure all theming needs are met through CSS variables, allowing dynamic updates without costly runtime style computations.
- Deprecate usage of dynamic styling props like the `sx` prop in favor of class-based styling and theming via CSS variables.

This approach balances performance gains with the flexibility of modern CSS variables, addressing the key performance bottlenecks identified while preserving theming capabilities and maintainability.","## Decisions

1. Manually refactor styles to css files + css modules

   Use css variables from primer/primitives for inexpensive theming support, especially with server side rendering

2. Use css modules with hash

   By importing styles in the component, we can create an explicit dependency between the two. This enables applications using primer to have control over bundling and delivery.

   To begin with, we will ship a single css bundle that can be imported in the application. (example: `import '@primer/react/styles.css'`). When needed, we have the option to delegate bundling of css files to the application (they can be split by page or bundled as a common chunk for all react pages to share)

3. Keep styled-components underneath for supporting sx prop.

   Keep backward compatibility, we might change this in the future

Code example:

```jsx
import clsx from 'clsx'
import classNames from './ActionList.module.css'

const Button = ({className, sx, ...props}}) => {
  return (
    <Box
      as=""button""
      sx={sx}
      // it's important to pass both internal and props.className to the element
      className={clsx(classNames.ActionList, className)}
      {...props}
    >
    </Box>
  )
}
```"

> **Note**
> This ADR supercedes [`ADR 009`](./adr-009-interaction-tests.md)

We author tests using a combination of Jest and Playwright. Typically, Jest is
used for unit and integration tests and Playwright is used for Visual Regression
Tests against our Storybook.

In `ADR 009`, we proposed using Storybook's [`play`
functions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function) as
the recommended way to author tests that require tests based on user
interactions. In this ADR, we would like to revisit this decision.","## Decision

We will discontinue using Storybook's `play` functions as the primary method for authoring interaction-based tests. Instead, we will adopt Playwright as the dedicated framework for all interaction tests, including those against Storybook components.

This approach provides several benefits:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeping interaction tests within Playwright aligns with its strengths in end-to-end testing and user interaction simulation, while Jest remains focused on unit and integration tests.
- **Improved Test Reliability**: Playwright's robust API for browser automation ensures more reliable and maintainable interaction tests.
- **Better Tooling and Debugging Support**: Playwright offers rich debugging tools and reporting, which enhances test development and maintenance.
- **Consistent Testing Across Environments**: By running Playwright tests against Storybook components, we ensure a consistent interface and accurate visual regression combined with interaction validation.

To implement this, we will:

- Define Playwright test suites targeting Storybook stories directly.
- Remove reliance on Storybook `play` functions for test logic.
- Update documentation to reflect the new testing strategy.
- Provide training and examples to help the team adopt Playwright for interaction testing.

This decision supersedes the approach defined in ADR 009 and streamlines our testing strategy for greater effectiveness and maintainability.","## Decision

For tests involving interaction, use Playwright to visit a storybook story and
interact with the component directly. This will allow for easy integration with
Visual Regression Testing and our automated accessibility testing (through axe).
In order to perform interactions, use [actions from
Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/input)."
"## Context

There are situations where a component prop can support a value or a ""responsive
value"" that results in the value changing depending on the viewport size. For
example:

```tsx
// Value
<Stack gap=""condensed"" />

// Responsive value
<Stack gap={{ narrow: 'condensed', regular: 'normal', wide: 'spacious' />
```

Typically, a responsive value will support all of our named breakpoints: narrow,
regular, and wide. Authors can use a hook called `useResponsiveValue` to support
resolving the value of a prop based on the current viewport size. The
implementation of this hook uses [`matchMedia`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia)
which, unfortunately, has a downside: the value of a prop may shift when the
component is server-side rendered. If the prop is used for styles or layout, then this will lead to a layout shift
when the component hydrates and the viewport size is different than the fallback
size on the server.

As a result, we would like to offer a paved path for providing responsive props
in a way tha twill not lead to layout shift during server-side rendering.","## Decision

To prevent layout shifts caused by responsive values during server-side rendering (SSR), we will adopt a strategic two-step approach for handling responsive props:

1. **Server-render with a deterministic fallback value:**  
   On the server, responsive props will resolve to a fixed fallback value that is consistent and independent of the actual client viewport size. This fallback will be chosen to best approximate the most common or minimal layout footprint to avoid drastic layout changes on hydration.

2. **Client-side dynamic resolution using `useResponsiveValue`:**  
   On the client, after hydration, the `useResponsiveValue` hook will use `matchMedia` to detect the current viewport size and update the prop value accordingly. This ensures responsive behavior without causing layout shifts during SSR.

Additionally:

- We will document this pattern clearly for component authors, emphasizing that responsive props should be designed to support a stable fallback value for SSR.

- For critical layout-affecting props, we will encourage providing explicit fallback values or disabling responsiveness on the server when layout stability is a priority.

- Future enhancements may include advanced hydration strategies, such as using user-agent hints or cookies to approximate client viewport on the server, but these are out of scope for the current implementation.

This approach balances SSR consistency with responsive flexibility while minimizing layout shifts and preserving UX integrity.","## Decision

Authors should use data attributes to bridge between responsive values in
JavaScript and the corresponding styles in CSS. Authors should avoid using
JavaScript-driven mechanisms for controlling responsive values in order to
prevent layout shift during SSR.

For example, consider a `Stack` component that has a `gap` prop. This prop can
receive a plain value or one that is a responsive value. To support this,
authors should use the following patterns:

```tsx
type GapScale = 'none' | 'condensed' | 'normal' | 'spacious'

type StackProps = React.PropsWithChildren<{
  // Responsive props should be a union of the value of the prop plus
  // `ResponsiveValue` over that value
  gap?: GapScale | ResponsiveValue<GapScale>
}>

function Stack({children, gap}: StackProps) {
  // The `getResponsiveAttributes` helper is useful for adding the corresponding
  // `data-*` attributes to the container for the compnoent.
  //
  // In this case, it will add `data-gap` and `data-gap-{breakpoint}` attributes
  // with the corresponding value set
  return <StyledStack {...getResponsiveAttributes('gap', gap)}>{children}</StyledStack>
}

const StyledStack = styled.div`
  &[data-gap='none'],
  &[data-gap-narrow='none'] {
    /* ... */
  }

  &[data-gap='condensed'],
  &[data-gap-narrow='condensed'] {
    /* ... */
  }

  /* ... */

  // @custom-media --viewportRange-regular
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    &[data-gap-regular='none'] {
      /* ... */
    }

    &[data-gap-regular='condensed'] {
      /* ... */
    }

    /* ... */
  }

  // @custom-media --viewportRange-wide
  @media (min-width: 1400px) {
    &[data-gap-wide='none'] {
      /* ... */
    }

    &[data-gap-wide='condensed'] {
      /* ... */
    }

    /* ... */
  }
`
```

By default, this approach uses the following conventions:

- Props which may have responsive values should have a value that is
  serializable, ideally as a `string` or `boolean`
- Props will be provided on the component as a data attribute, using the format:
  `data-{propName}`
- For responsive values, the breakpoint name will be appended to the data
  attribute name specified above. For example: `data-{propName}-{breakpoint}`

Data attributes will act as a bridge between JavaScript and CSS. In CSS, authors
should use these data attributes to apply styles based on the value of the
attribute per-breakpoint.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a utility named `getResponsiveAttributes` that can be used to generate
> the corresponding `data-*` attributes for the props which may have responsive
> values."
"## Context

There are times when a prop is deprecated in favor of a more accessible API or a more flexible prop that can support a wider range of values. In these cases, we want to provide a clear path for authors to migrate from the deprecated prop to the new API.

For
example:

```tsx
// old API
<ActionList>
  <ActionList.Group title=""Group title"">
    <ActionList.Item>Item 1</ActionList.Item>
    <ActionList.Item>Item 2</ActionList.Item>
  </ActionList.Group>
</ActionList>
```

```tsx
// new API
<ActionList>
  <ActionList.Group>
    <ActionList.GroupHeading as=""h2"">Group title</ActionList.GroupHeading>
    <ActionList.Item>Item 1</ActionList.Item>
    <ActionList.Item>Item 2</ActionList.Item>
  </ActionList.Group>
</ActionList>
```","## Decision

We will implement a deprecation strategy that provides clear, actionable guidance for users to migrate from deprecated props to new APIs. Specifically, when a prop is deprecated:

1. **Deprecation Warnings:** Emit console warnings in development environments whenever the deprecated prop is used, indicating the preferred new API and providing example usage.

2. **Documentation Updates:** Update the component documentation to clearly mark deprecated props, explain why they are deprecated, and show side-by-side examples of the old and new usage patterns.

3. **Transitional Support:** Maintain the deprecated prop functionality temporarily to avoid breaking changes, allowing users time to transition.

4. **Accessibility and Flexibility Focus:** The new API design should be more accessible and flexible, as in the example where `Group title` prop is replaced by a `GroupHeading` subcomponent with an explicit `as` prop for semantic control.

5. **Code Modifications:** Refactor components to support both APIs during the transition; for example, render `GroupHeading` internally when the deprecated `title` prop is used, while showing warnings.

6. **Timeline and Removal:** Set a clear timeline for removing deprecated props in future major releases, communicated via changelogs and migration guides.

This approach ensures users are well-informed, reduces migration friction, promotes best practices (e.g., improved accessibility), and maintains backward compatibility during the transition period.","## Decision

1. Add the `@deprecated` TS notice, if possible, to the corresponding type
2. Mark the prop as deprecated in the component's documentation
3. Add an eslint rule or extend an existing one to warn against using the deprecated prop
4. Update the `primer/react` eslint plugin at github/github and evaluate the impact of the deprecation
5. If the change is minimal and safe, proceed with the auto fix of the eslint rule and create PRs by codeowners
6. If the change is large, add an eslint disable to each instance of the deprecated prop at github/github and make sure they show up on the accessibility score cards so that we can track the usage of the deprecated prop
7. Enable the eslint rule afterwards in github/github so that the new instances of the deprecated prop are heavily discouraged"
"## Context

- Proxy support is required for some enterprises and organizations to start using their own self-hosted runners
- While there is not a standard convention, many applications support setting proxies via the environment variables `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `no_proxy`, such as curl, wget, perl, python, docker, git, and R
  - Some of these applications use `HTTPS_PROXY` versus `https_proxy`, but most understand or primarily support the lowercase variant","## Decision

To support proxy configuration for self-hosted runners, we will adopt the widely-used convention of reading proxy settings from the environment variables `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy`. The implementation will prioritize the lowercase variants of these variables, as they are most commonly supported across popular tools and programming languages. To ensure compatibility, we will also check for their uppercase counterparts (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`) as fallback options. This approach maximizes interoperability with existing enterprise environments and minimizes configuration friction for users behind proxies.","## Decision

We will update the Runner to use the conventional environment variables for proxies: `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` if they are set.
These are described in detail below:
- `https_proxy` a proxy URL for all https traffic. It may contain basic authentication credentials. For example:
  - http://proxy.com
  - http://127.0.0.1:8080
  - http://user:password@proxy.com
- `http_proxy` a proxy URL for all http traffic. It may contain basic authentication credentials. For example:
  - http://proxy.com
  - http://127.0.0.1:8080
  - http://user:password@proxy.com
- `no_proxy` a comma-separated list of hosts that should not use the proxy. An optional port may be specified. For example:
  - `google.com`
  - `yahoo.com:443`
  - `google.com,bing.com`

We won't use `http_proxy` for https traffic when `https_proxy` is not set, this behavior lines up with any libcurl based tools (curl, git) and wget.
Otherwise, action authors and workflow users need to adjust to differences between the runner proxy convention, and tools used by their actions and scripts.  

Example:  
  Customer sets `http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888` and configures the runner against `https://github.com/owner/repo`, with the `https_proxy` -> `http_proxy` fallback, the runner will connect to the server without any problem. However, if a user runs `git push` to `https://github.com/owner/repo`, `git` won't use the proxy since it requires `https_proxy` to be set for any https traffic.

> `golang`, `node.js`, and other dev tools from the Linux community use `http_proxy` for both http and https traffic based on my research.

A majority of our users are using Linux where these variables are commonly required to be set by various programs. By reading these values, we simplify the process for self-hosted runners to set up a proxy and expose it in a way users are already familiar with.

A password provided for a proxy will be masked in the logs.

We will support the lowercase and uppercase variants, with lowercase taking priority if both are set."
"## Context

Command echoing as a default behavior tends to clutter the user logs, so we want to swap to a system where users have to opt in to see this information.

Command outputs will still be echoed in the case there are any errors processing such commands. This is so the end user can have more context on why the command failed and help with troubleshooting.

Echo output in the user logs can be explicitly controlled by the new commands `::echo::on` and `::echo::off`. By default, echoing is enabled if `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret is enabled, otherwise echoing is disabled.","## Decision

We will disable command echoing by default to reduce log clutter. Command echoing will be enabled only when the user explicitly opts in by using the `::echo::on` command or when the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret is set. Regardless of echoing settings, command outputs will always be echoed if errors occur during command processing to aid troubleshooting. The commands `::echo::on` and `::echo::off` will provide users explicit control over echo behavior in their logs.","## Decision
- The only commands that currently echo output are
  - `remove-matcher`
  - `add-matcher`
  - `add-path`
- These will no longer echo the command, if processed successfully
- All commands echo the input when any of these conditions is fulfilled:
  1. When such commands fail with an error
  2. When `::echo::on` is set
  3. When the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` is set, and echoing hasn't been explicitly disabled with `::echo::off`
- There are a few commands that won't be echoed, even when echo is enabled. These are (as of 2019/11/04):
   - `add-mask`
   - `debug`
   - `warning`
   - `error`
- The three commands above will not echo, either because echoing the command would leak secrets (e.g. `add-mask`), or it would not add any additional troubleshooting information to the logs (e.g. `debug`). It's expected that future commands would follow these ""echo-suppressing"" guidelines as well. Echo-suppressed commands are still free to output other information to the logs, as deemed fit."
"## Context

- Provide a mechanism in the runner to include extra information in `Set up job` step's log.
  Ex: Include OS/Software info from Hosted image.","## Decision

We will extend the runner's logging capabilities in the `Set up job` step to include detailed environment metadata, such as OS version and pre-installed software information from the hosted image. This will be achieved by modifying the runner to collect relevant system information at the start of the job execution and append this data to the existing logs in a structured and readable format. This approach enhances transparency and aids in troubleshooting without impacting the job execution flow or requiring changes from job definitions.","## Decision

The runner will look for a file `.setup_info` under the runner's root directory, The file can be a JSON with a simple schema.
```json
[
  {
    ""group"": ""OS Detail"",
    ""detail"": ""........""
  },
  {
    ""group"": ""Software Detail"",
    ""detail"": ""........""
  }
]
```
The runner will use `::group` and `::endgroup` to fold all detail info into an expandable group.

Both [virtual-environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) and self-hosted runners can use this mechanism to add extra logging info to the `Set up job` step's log."
"## Context

This ADR proposes adding `steps.<id>.outcome` and `steps.<id>.conclusion` to the steps context.

This allows downstream a step to run based on whether a previous step succeeded or failed.

Reminder, currently the steps contains `steps.<id>.outputs`.","## Decision

We will extend the existing steps context by adding two new fields: `steps.<id>.outcome` and `steps.<id>.conclusion`. 

- `steps.<id>.outcome` will represent the general result of the step execution, such as `success`, `failure`, or `cancelled`.
- `steps.<id>.conclusion` will provide a more detailed final status once the step has completed, aligned with the conventions established in similar systems (e.g., `success`, `failure`, `neutral`, `cancelled`, `skipped`).

This addition enables downstream steps to conditionally execute based on the success or failure of prior steps without relying solely on outputs, improving control flow expressiveness in workflows. 

The existing `steps.<id>.outputs` property will remain unchanged for passing data between steps. These new properties strictly provide metadata about step execution status.

This approach avoids breaking existing workflows while adding valuable capabilities for error handling and conditional execution.","## Decision

For steps that have completed, populate `steps.<id>.outcome` and `steps.<id>.conclusion` with one of the following values:

- `success`
- `failure`
- `cancelled`
- `skipped`

When a continue-on-error step fails, the outcome will be `failure` even though the final conclusion is `success`."
"## Context

Since configuring self-hosted runners is commonly automated via scripts, the labels need to be able to be created during configuration.  The runner currently registers the built-in labels (os, arch) during registration but does not accept labels via command line args to extend the set registered.

See Issue: https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/262

This is another version of [ADR275](https://github.com/actions/runner/pull/275)","## Decision

We will extend the self-hosted runner registration process to accept additional user-defined labels via command line arguments. This enhancement will allow automation scripts to specify custom labels at the time of runner configuration, ensuring that any required labels beyond the built-in defaults (os, arch) are registered immediately.

Specifically, the runner will introduce a new optional parameter, such as `--labels`, which accepts a comma-separated list of custom labels. These labels will be validated and merged with the built-in labels during the registration step. This approach maintains backward compatibility, avoids manual post-registration label addition, and supports fully automated runner setup workflows.

This decision aligns with the request highlighted in Issue #262 and supersedes the previous approach described in ADR275 by simplifying label management during runner registration.","## Decision

This ADR proposes that we add a `--labels` option to the `config`, which could be used to add custom additional labels to the configured runner.

For example, to add a single additional label the operator could run:
```bash
./config.sh --labels mylabel
```
> Note: the current runner command line parsing and envvar override algorithm only support a single argument (key).

This would add the label `mylabel` to the runner, and enable users to select the runner in their workflow using this label:
```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, mylabel]
```

To add multiple labels the operator could run:
```bash
./config.sh --labels mylabel,anotherlabel
```
> Note: the current runner command line parsing and envvar override algorithm only supports a single argument (key).

This would add the label `mylabel` and `anotherlabel` to the runner, and enable users to select the runner in their workflow using this label:
```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, mylabel, anotherlabel]
```

It would not be possible to remove labels from an existing runner using `config.sh`, instead labels would have to be removed using the GitHub UI.

The labels argument will split on commas, trim and discard empty strings.  That effectively means don't use commas in unattended config label names.  Alternatively, we could choose to escape commas but it's a nice to have."

SS?? fundamentally relies on a third-party provider service to authenticate requests (e.g. OAuth2
via Google). The provider may experience transient faults for any number of reasons - perhaps the
provider is experiencing a transient outage, or our traffic has been temporarily rate limited. We
wanted to build SS?? to anticipate and handle the presence of faults during communication with
authentication providers, no matter the underlying cause.","## Decision
To handle transient faults when communicating with third-party authentication providers, SS?? will implement a resilient authentication request mechanism incorporating exponential backoff and retry policies. Requests that fail due to transient errors or rate limiting will be retried with increasing intervals, up to a configured maximum number of attempts. Additionally, circuit breaker patterns will be employed to avoid overwhelming the provider during outages, temporarily halting requests after repeated failures before attempting recovery. This approach ensures improved reliability and user experience despite intermittent provider issues.","## Decision
We implemented a generic `circuit.Breaker` type, which implements the ""Circuit Breaker"" design
pattern made popular by Michael T. Nygard's book, [""Release It!""](
https://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it). All requests to the provider service are issued through
a stateful `circuit.Breaker` instance, which tracks the frequency of request failures. When the
`Breaker` sees that enough requests are failing, it temporarily suspends all outgoing traffic to the
provider (i.e. ""enters `Open` state). After some time, the `Breaker` transitions to a `HalfOpen`
state, in which a limited number of outbound requests are allowed. If failures persist, then the
`Breaker` will once again suspend outbound traffic, re-enter `Open` state, and typically will wait
for a longer interval of time before trying again. If instead the `Breaker` observes that requests
are consistently succeeding, then it will resume all outbound traffic (i.e. enter `Closed` state).

The SS?? [`docs`](/docs/) directory contains a [Circuit Breaker](
/docs/architecture/circuit-breaker.md) document with more details. The implementation can be found
in [`breaker.go`](/internal/auth/circuit/breaker.go)"

We make a lot of decisions during the life of a project and
documenting those decisions would help new team members and outside
contributors follow our thinking. It also opens up an opportunity for
constructive criticism around those decisions which will result
in better decision making.

We want to develop a product in the open. Opening up our decision making process for outside contributors is an important part in providing the opportunity to take ownership and impact the project in non-trivial ways.

Recording decisions will also be a useful form of documentation in general as it does not get out of date. All that's documented is that a decision has been made at a certain point in time.","## Decision

We will adopt the use of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to document all significant architectural and process decisions throughout the project's lifecycle. These ADRs will be maintained in a dedicated directory within the project's open-source repository to ensure transparency and accessibility to all contributors, both internal and external. This approach will formalize our decision-making process, provide historical context for decisions, encourage constructive feedback, and empower contributors to understand and influence the project direction effectively.","## Decision

Extensions are defined by an EDN file accessed from decentralized storage. An URI schema allows to identify those files.","## Decision

We will adopt a custom URI schema, `edn://`, to reference extension definition files stored on decentralized storage networks. This schema will clearly indicate that the linked resource is an EDN file describing an extension, enabling clients to resolve and fetch the extension metadata uniformly across different decentralized storage backends. This approach ensures a standardized identification mechanism while keeping the system extensible to various decentralized storage implementations.","## Decision

We want to launch our beta in Q2. This requires us to keep a tight scope and stay on the critical path.

Group chat is not as vital as 1-1 chat for the chat experience. It is also
likely not as useful for an MVP as public chat is, since this gives people a
chance to talk to strangers and it is open by default.

Whether group chats are in scope or not has been a recurring discussing and a
lot of effort has been wasted related to this.

There are currently a lot of outstanding regressions related to group chat: https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/labels/group-chat Additionally, since group chats are private the encryption and security of those are generally harder than 1-1 and public chat.","## Decision

We will exclude group chat functionality from the MVP launch in Q2 and focus solely on 1-1 chat and public chat features. This decision is made to keep the scope tight, reduce complexity related to encryption and security challenges specific to group chats, and avoid further regressions and wasted effort. Group chat will be considered for implementation in post-MVP releases once the critical path for the beta launch is secured.","## Decision

Disable group chat for beta and don't work on bugs related to it until after. See https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/3995

time to fix group chats properly."

Currently peers for messaging are hardcoded in the app. This means we can't
easily scale, as some of these nodes might fill up when we have more than N
active users.

Discovery v5 protocol (https://ideas.status.im/ideas/092-disc-v5-research,
https://github.com/fjl/p2p-drafts/blob/master/discv5-eip.md) allow us to
discover new peers from the app and scale server peers in our cluster
independently. This is vital for high availability/reliability and security.","## Decision

We will implement the Discovery v5 protocol to dynamically discover and connect to peers instead of using hardcoded peer addresses. This approach allows the application to automatically find available nodes in the network, thereby enhancing scalability and load distribution. By leveraging Discovery v5, we can independently scale server peers in our cluster, improving high availability, reliability, and security. The peer discovery mechanism will be integrated within the app’s networking layer, replacing the static peer list with dynamic discovery and connection management based on the Discovery v5 protocol specifications.","## Decision

- Use and enable Discovery v5 for all networks
- Do this before beta is released

This means we have capacity to achieve 5000+ DAU / 500 concurrent connection. It
seems unlikely we can do so with reliable messaging in the current setup.

Trade-off for this is:
- Uncertainty in introducing a new protocol leading to possible delays
- Possible increase in CPU/Network (we can disable protocol once peers are found though)"

We will adopt the new key generation method based on the 12 mnemonic words as described in Idea 142-Wallet-Compatibility. This approach will standardize wallet creation across different applications, enabling users to import and use the same wallet address in Status and other compatible apps seamlessly.

"## Context

On the path to releasing a usable beta we've faced a variety of performance
issues:

- https://github.com/status-im/ideas/issues/55
- https://ideas.status.im/ideas/071-low-traffic
- https://ideas.status.im/ideas/076-smooth-ui
- https://ideas.status.im/ideas/083-energy-efficient

Some of these performance issues are related to the use of LES, especially on
Mainnet. Examples of problems include: slow/hot sync, disk filling up, bandwidth
usage, etc. This can partly be remedied by the use of CHT to speed up sync
(https://github.com/status-im/status-go/wiki/Updating-CHT-BloomTrie).

In order to simplify the problem, we decided earlier this year to not spend too
much time looking into performance improvements related to LES, instead focusing
our efforts on improving the performance on Whisper and in client-side code.

This also means we don't have a full picture of to what extent LES is a
performance bottleneck for the Status app. It is possible proper use of CHT,
slowing sync down, vary load depending on if you are on WiFi or not, etc, can
solve these problems. However, the consensus right now is that ULC is the more
promising route to take.

However, since ULC isn't ready yet, this means we are relying on Infura. This
is a bad idea from a decentralization and security point of view. This can be
partly remedied by allowing the user to run an upstream node. It is still a bad
trust model, relying on third-party Ethereum nodes, and we want to get away
from this as soon as possible.

With ULC it is possible to connect to more than one node, which increases
decentralization and security.","## Decision

We will prioritize the transition to Ultra Light Client (ULC) architecture as the long-term solution to LES-related performance issues and decentralization concerns. In the interim, while ULC is not yet ready, the app will continue to rely on Infura as the default Ethereum node provider for syncing and data access to ensure usability.

To mitigate centralization risks during this interim period, we will implement support for users to configure and run their own upstream Ethereum nodes. This hybrid approach balances usability with some degree of decentralization and allows users greater control while maintaining app functionality.

Performance improvements related to LES (such as optimizing CHT usage) will remain a lower priority, given the strategic focus on ULC. Once ULC is available and stable, we will phase out dependence on Infura and legacy LES syncing, enabling connections to multiple nodes simultaneously to enhance both performance and decentralization.","## Decision

1. Rely on upstream nodes for beta. For the closed beta scheduled to be releases
Q2 we will provide two ways of accessing the Ethereum network:

- Upstream RPC with Infura (default)
- Custom upstream node (https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/3994)

From a decentralization point of view we need the latter before we can release
the beta.

2. ULC MVP. Additionally, as soon as beta is released, assess and start to
   introduce ULC as an experimental non-default mode in the app.
   
By doing this we also support the network, since it is still a very new
protocol. ULC requires trusted peers to operate, and right now trust is
established by config (list of trusted peers).

Initially we could hardcode these nodes, with option to add your own. Later on
we can have some form of distributed directory with a rating system. This also
likely requires merging ULC upstream, so we aren't the only ones running trusted
nodes.

3. LES track (optional). If we still have resources and there's interest,
optionally run a parallel track to clean up LES usage (update CHT, cluster) and
understand exact performance impact and viablity of running LES on
resource-constrained devices.

These three decisions balances the following trade-offs:

- get a usable beta released as soon as possible
- provide users with options to get minimal amount of decentralization
- pave the way for trustless usage by default (ULC/LES node)"
"## Context

We have some data that we don't want to appear in the logs (user passwords are
a good example). Currently, they are passed around as strings, that could be
printed out by mistake in a log entry (see https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/4053)","## Decision

To prevent sensitive data such as user passwords from appearing in logs, we will introduce a dedicated secure data type or wrapper class for sensitive strings. This type will override the default string representation methods (e.g., `toString()`, `__repr__()`) to ensure that the actual content is never printed or logged unintentionally. Instead, it can display a placeholder like `<redacted>` or `<sensitive>`.

Additionally, we will enforce code review checks and logging best practices to ensure that this data type is used consistently for all sensitive fields and that raw sensitive strings are not logged or exposed in any debug output.

By adopting this approach, we reduce the risk of leaking sensitive information through logs while maintaining flexibility in handling sensitive data securely within the application.","## Decision

To minimize the risk of leaking passwords through logs, we should not pass
passwords as strings in our codebase. We introduced a new type `MaskedData` in
`status-im.utils.security`.
update (16-Dec-2022) `status-im.utils.security` is now moved over to `utils.security.core` 

We use `(security/mask-data <data to hide>` to wrap sensitive data into this
type and then use `(security/unmask <masked-data>)` to get the plaintext back.

It is important to keep that sensitive data masked as much as possible, until
you need the plaintext to pass to the extenral APIs.

Example:
```clojure
(println (security/mask-data ""my-plaintext-password"")) ;; Outputs ""******""
(println (security/unmask (security/mask-data ""my-plaintext-password""))) ;; Outputs ""my-plaintext-password""
```"
"## Context

Originally, we supported 3rd party status extensions in form of javascript jailed execution environment (eq Jail) + small js library exposing chat commands API to js code.

While neat in theory, it has some serious downsides:

- Design of the API was quite poor, preferring mutable semantics over stateless API leveraging strength of the host application (cljs/re-frame).
  As a result of that, more dynamic/state requiring things (like the live tx detail in `/send` command messages) were very hard to do,
  so instead of ""eating our own dogfood"", we decided to side-step the API and implement such things as hard-coded logic in the app, while partly
  retaining the js code for ""easier"" things (like parameter declaration).
  Needles to say, such efforts produced code of very poor quality, riddling our app with hard-coded ""magic"" everywhere in the codebase, completely
  defeating the point of ""dogfooding"" while still requiring more effort and being much more error prone (no way to unit test jail logic) because 
  of the need to asynchronously communicate with jail for leftover logic in command messages (the parts not hardcoded in app).
  
- We were in a state where there was not even one command defined completely in jail, with all of them requiring custom hardcoded logic in app to
  actually work.
  Due to numerous changes and rush to get things working, half of the API was obsolete and was not working/working differently then described in
  the API documentation.
  
- We are quite tight stretched regarding performance and the Jail didn't particularly help with that - whenever some command message was defined in
  Jail, it required constant RN Bridge ""ping-pong"" whenever sending the message or receiving the message, eating more resources + breaking otherwise
  quite simple logic into harder to reason asynchronous call chains (execute method defined in Jail, wait for the result, execute next method in Jail...).
  
- Till now, there was no real interest in 3rd party bots anyway - the only ""real"" DAPPs submitted to status were ""normal"" DAPPs utilising just the `web3.js`
  API and built on top of regular web technologies, so they could be ran in any Ethereum client like Metamask or Mist, besides Status.
  
- There is a very promising new concept of extensions (project pluto), which will enable to extend status with much nicer and declarative extension
  definitions.
  Such extensions will not be able to only hook-in into the command messages logic, but also other application (host) hooks, like wallet assets/collectibles,
  chat contacts, etc.","## Decision

We will deprecate and remove the existing 3rd party status extensions mechanism based on the javascript jailed execution environment (Jail) and the small JS library exposing the chat commands API. Instead, we will fully embrace the new extensibility framework brought by Project Pluto, which provides a declarative and versatile extension model.

Concretely, we will:

- Retire all support for defining commands and extensions via Jail, eliminating the associated asynchronous RN Bridge communication and mutable-state APIs.

- Migrate command and extension logic currently split between hardcoded app code and Jail scripts into declarative extensions using the Project Pluto framework.

- Build new extension APIs with stateless, testable, and composable patterns that leverage the strengths of the host application architecture (e.g., cljs/re-frame), avoiding mutable semantics.

- Focus on enabling a richer integration surface beyond chat commands (wallet assets, collectibles, contacts, etc.), as provided by Project Pluto’s host hooks.

- Align developer documentation, tooling, and onboarding to support the new extension model, discouraging any new development using the legacy Jail-based approach.

This decision aims to improve code quality, maintainability, performance, developer experience, and future extensibility by moving away from an error-prone and limited Jail implementation towards a modern, declarative extension system.","## Decision

In the light of points above, we decided to remove Jail and `Status.js` API from the application and re-work command messages in set of nicely
encapsulated app level protocols, so command related logic will be defined in one place, commands will be able to leverage strength of our platform
and development of any new functionality related to them will be much faster and more pleasant. 
We will address the 3rd party code issue separately by extensions."

The whitepaper describes Tribute to Talk (TtT) as an economics-based anti-spam filter for receiving messages and ""cold"" contact requests from user. Stakeholders would stake a minimum amount of SNT that another Status stakeholder must deposit in order to contact him directly.
The whitepaper also proposes that the deposit is only forfeited to the recipient if he replies.","## Decision

We will implement the Tribute to Talk (TtT) mechanism as an economics-based anti-spam filter for direct messaging and cold contact requests. Specifically, when a user (sender) wants to message another user (recipient) who is a Status stakeholder, the sender must stake a minimum amount of SNT tokens as a deposit. This deposit will only be forfeited to the recipient if the recipient replies to the message, aligning incentives to reduce spam while ensuring that users are not unduly penalized for ignoring unwanted messages. This approach balances user privacy, spam mitigation, and economic incentives within the Status messaging ecosystem.","## Decision

Considering:
- the absence of efficient ways to perform anonymous transactions (zk-snarks could be used in the future for that)
- the impossibility to prove that a recipient has made an actual reply and not some kind of automated reply (captcha solution was proposed, but wouldn't be practical until we can use a solution such as swarm feeds that allow users to make free updates to their captcha without on-chain transactions)
- the limited time to develop the feature

We opted for a solution that:
- doesn't establish a direct correlation between the tribute payment and an on-chain transaction, so it
- uses regular transactions for tributes payment, giving users plausible deniability about the nature of the payment
- doesn't store tribute information on-chain"

Currently, there is only a single team lead in the mobile development team, and after a meeting with the design team, it has been identified that the mobile app lacks polishness. One of the main issues identified is a lack of oversight in certain areas. To address this problem, it has been decided to create an additional role within the team. For each section of the mobile app (communities, syncing & onboarding, activity center & shell, wallet, messaging), a person will be selected to fulfill the responsibilities outlined below.","## Decision

These Area Leads will act as subject matter experts and oversee the design, development, and quality assurance specific to their respective areas. This distributed leadership model will enhance accountability, improve product polish, and ensure focused ownership for critical features, complementing the existing team lead’s overall coordination role.","## Decision

The decision is to create an additional role within the mobile development team for each section. The individuals selected for these roles will have the following responsibilities:

- Ensure GitHub issues are created for new features/designs of the section.
- Ensure issues are adequately described and linked as best as possible.
- Ensure issues have a grooming session where other developers can provide their feedback before working on the set of issues.
- Ensure all relevant parties are invited, such as designers, QA, Product Owner, leads, etc., as needed (including the designer who created the feature).
- Ensure there is consensus among the developers working on the section about the decided strategy approach. Ideally, this consensus should be documented.
- Ensure UI quality by organizing designer reviews and guaranteeing pixel perfection.
- Ensure overall implementation is satisfactory based on the predefined requirements.
- Ensure alignment between desktop, web, and mobile versions for the respective section in collaboration with the mobile developers and design team.
- Act as a point of contact for the design team with respect to the section.
- Ensure that someone goes through the designs once they are created with the respective designer.
- Assist the design team with technical feasibility analysis and address any product concerns.
- Facilitate the growth of the next team member into the role.

The people identified for each sections are as follow:

- Messaging @flexsurfer, followed by @alwx
- Syncing & Onboarding @siddarthkay
- Communities @ilmotta, followed by @ajayesivan
- Activity Center & Shell @J-Son89, followed by @Parveshdhull
- Wallet (once the vertical team is created) @J-Son89, followed by @briansztamfater

This will be a rotating post, every 4 months it will go to the next in line.

The wallet team might have longer times for rotation, as stability might be more important. That's still to be decided.

During the development of a new Sylius API (based on API Platform) for Product Options, we had to decide how we should handle
Product Option's values collection, to make it efficient and easy to use.","## Decision

We decided to represent Product Option's values as a dedicated subresource within the API Platform, exposing it through nested routes such as `/product_options/{id}/values`. This approach allows clear separation between the option entity and its values, improves clarity in API usage, and leverages API Platform's built-in capabilities for managing collections.

To ensure efficiency, the collection endpoints will support pagination, filtering, and sorting. Additionally, we will implement batch update and delete operations to handle multiple values in a single request, reducing client-server interactions. This design also aligns with REST principles by treating the values as a related resource rather than embedding them directly in the Product Option payload.

Overall, this approach balances ease of use for API consumers with maintainability and performance considerations in the backend.","## Decision and reasoning

Product option values should always be provided with their IRIs. They can exist outside of the `ProductOption` resource 
(e.g. be [related with](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Component/Product/Model/ProductVariant.php#L44) `ProductVariant`).
Moreover, values embedded together with their translations in the `ProductOption` that already has its translations would
result in a massive and unmanageable response."
"## Context and Problem Statement

A big chunk of resources available in Sylius have some part locale aware. Product descriptions, names of payment or shipping methods
should be translated to the customer to provide the best user experience. Right now most of the resources are returned with 
all available translations in the store and proper localization of content is left to the frontend developers. What is more,
this solution is not consistent, as some endpoints already embeds some part of translatables in them. We should provide clear,
easy to use and consistent way of handling customer locales.","## Decision

We will implement server-side locale resolution and filtering of translatable resource fields based on the customer’s locale preference. The API will accept a locale parameter or infer the locale from the request context (e.g., HTTP headers or user profile) and return only the relevant translations for each resource. This ensures consistent, localized content delivery from the backend, reducing frontend complexity and improving user experience.

Specifically:
- Introduce a standardized way to specify locale in API requests, such as a query parameter (`locale=xx_XX`) or HTTP `Accept-Language` header support.
- Modify API endpoints to filter translation fields so that only translations matching the requested locale are included in the response.
- Provide a fallback mechanism to default locale when the requested locale translations are not available.
- Update data models and serialization logic to support locale-aware responses consistently across all relevant resources (e.g., product descriptions, payment, shipping method names).
- Document the new locale handling approach clearly for frontend developers.

This approach balances consistency, performance, and ease of use, and enhances the internationalization capabilities of the Sylius platform.","## Decision Outcome

The first approach should be used in admin section of API, while the third one should be used in shop section. This way, we
will receive best of both worlds with the minimal effort. It is worth mentioning that Sylius have two distinguish entry points
to API - admin and shop. They are concerned about different things and resolves different problems. Unified view of a product
in the shop will make it easy and straightforward to build product pages. At the same time all translation approach should be used in
admin to provide full control over ""translation"" resource - as we should treat them. Therefore, every resource translation
should be linked to the main resource through IRI. Each of these translation resource may be a subject of all CRUD operations
accessible throughout HTTP Verbs."

To detect pull request changes, we can use webhooks or polling using GitHub's
API.","## Decision

We will use GitHub webhooks to detect pull request changes. This approach allows for real-time notifications of pull request events without the overhead and delay associated with frequent polling. Webhooks provide a more efficient and scalable solution by pushing updates as they happen, reducing API usage and latency in detecting changes.","## Decision

We decided to start with polling for security reasons. Using webhooks would require users to
open an ingress to the cluster. Because of this requirement, we think security conscious folks may refuse to roll this out on production clusters especially in an
air-gapped environment. This does not mean that we will never consider using webhooks for this, but that initially, polling is what we have chosen to implement.

"## Context

Like [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/), the tf-controller API has a handful
of places where it accepts cross-namespace references.

 - `Terraform.spec.sourceRef` -- refers to the Flux source object with
   the Terraform program
 - `Terraform.spec.dependsOn[]` -- refers to other objects that must
   be ready before this object can be run
 - `.data.resources[]` -- in the config struct used by the branch
   planner

In general in Kubernetes, references to objects in other namespaces
are frowned upon, because

 - they break namespace isolation assurances; and,
 - they encourage the proliferation of permissions.

Both of these effects make a system less secure.

However: removing cross-namespace refs entirely would break some
installations in a way that would be difficult to fix, because Flux
deployments often rely on defining sources away from objects that use
them.","## Decision

We will continue to support cross-namespace references in the tf-controller API but restrict them to a well-defined, minimal set of fields (`spec.sourceRef`, `spec.dependsOn[]`, and `.data.resources[]`) where cross-namespace references are necessary for operational flexibility. To mitigate security risks and preserve namespace isolation as much as possible, we will:

- Clearly document the intended use cases and risks associated with cross-namespace references.
- Implement fine-grained RBAC policies that limit who can create or modify cross-namespace references.
- Encourage users to colocate related resources in the same namespace when feasible to minimize cross-namespace dependencies.
- Monitor and audit cross-namespace reference usage regularly to detect and remediate overly broad permissions or misconfigurations.

This approach balances the need for operational flexibility exemplified by Flux’s design while acknowledging and managing the security implications inherent in cross-namespace references.","## Decision

Deny cross-namespace references by default, but allow them to be
enabled with a flag.

So that the default value means the right thing, the flag name must be
`enable-cross-namespace-refs`, and the default `false`. To avoid
confusion when people try to use the Flux version of this flag
`--disable-cross-namespace-refs`, it should be supported too, but only
respected if supplied."
"## Context

The TF-Controller currently faces challenges related to the deletion of Terraform resources.
These problems span across three categories:

1. Single object deletion,
2. Resources with dependencies deletion, and
3. Namespace deletion.

These problems must be fixed in the above order as (2) and (3) require single object deletion to be resolved first.

Deleting a single TF object can sometimes be obstructed because it's tied to other resources like Source objects, Secrets, and ConfigMaps. If we try to remove it without deleting these resources, the TF object gets stuck in an inconsistent state, making it harder for users to manage their infrastructure smoothly.
Therefore, the TF-Controller is being enhanced to address this problem more efficiently, using the contents of generated Workspace BLOBs. Each BLOB contains all necessary information from the associated Source, Secrets, and ConfigMaps to ensure that TF-Controller finalization procedures can delete objects correctly.

Currently, the TF-Controller downloads a Source BLOB and pushes it to a tf-runner. The tf-runner processes this BLOB to create a Workspace file system. It generates a backend configuration file, variable files, and other necessary files for the Workspace file system, using data from associated Secrets and ConfigMaps. This newly created Workspace file system is then compressed, sent back to the TF-Controller, and stored as a Workspace BLOB in the controller's storage.
A caching mechanism for these BLOBs is essential to fixing the single TF object deletion process.","## Decision

To resolve the single object deletion issue in the TF-Controller, we will implement a caching mechanism for Workspace BLOBs within the controller. This cache will store the compressed Workspace file systems generated by the tf-runner, including all necessary backend configurations, variable files, and related resource data extracted from Sources, Secrets, and ConfigMaps.

By caching these Workspace BLOBs, the TF-Controller will have direct, consistent access to the complete state and configuration required to finalize and delete Terraform resources safely, without relying on live external resources that may hinder deletion. This approach ensures that during deletion:

- The TF-Controller can accurately reconstruct the Workspace environment for Terraform operations,
- Resource dependencies managed through associated Secrets and ConfigMaps are correctly handled,
- Inconsistent or stuck TF object states will be avoided by ensuring finalization logic always has the complete and consistent data snapshot it requires.

This design also lays the groundwork for addressing resource dependency deletions and namespace-wide deletions by ensuring the base case of single resource deletion is fully resolved and robust.","## Decision

1. **BLOB Creation and Storage**
   * A gRPC function named `CreateWorkspaceBlob` will be invoked by the TF-Controller 
     to tell tf-runner to compress the Workspace file system into a tar.gz BLOB, which is then retrieved back to the controller.
   * The caching mechanism will be executed right before the Terraform Initialization step, ensuring that the latest and most relevant data is used.
   * Each Workspace Blob will be cached on the TF-Controller's local disk, using the UUID of the Terraform object as the filename,`${uuid}.tar.gz`.
   * To reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the cache entries, and cache collisions, the cache file will be deleted after the finalization process is complete.
2. **Persistence** 
   * [The persistence mechanism used by the Source Controller](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/configuration/vertical-scaling/#persistent-storage-for-flux-internal-artifacts) will be adopted for the TF-Controller's persistence volume.
3. **BLOB Encryption**
   * The encryption and decryption of the BLOBs will be tasked to the runner, with the controller solely responsible for storing encrypted BLOBs.
   * Each namespace will require a service account, preferably named ""tf-runner"".
   * The token of this service account, which is natively supported by Kubernetes, will serve as the most appropriate encryption key because it's stored in a Secret, access to which can be controlled by RBAC. Storing it in a Secret also allows the key to be rotated.
4. **Security Measures (Based on STRIDE Analysis)**
   * **Spoofing:** Implement Kubernetes RBAC for access restrictions and use mutual authentication for gRPC communications.
   * **Tampering:** Use checksums for integrity verification and 0600 permissions to write-protect local disk storage.
   * **Repudiation:** Ensure strong logging and auditing mechanisms for tracking activities.
   * **Information Disclosure:** Utilize robust encryption algorithms, rotate encryption keys periodically, and secure service account tokens.
   * **Denial of Service:** Monitor storage space and automate cleanup processes.
   * **Elevation of Privilege:** Minimize permissions associated with service account tokens.
5. **First MVP & Future Planning**
   * For the initial MVP, the default pod local volume will be used.
   * Since a controller restart will erase the BLOB cache, consideration for using persistent volumes should be made for subsequent versions."
"## Context

In previous releases of Zarf, the creation of the initialization package at the core of many of our E2E tests required repository secrets to login to registry1. Since this is an open-source project, anyone could submit a change to one of our GitHub workflows that could steal our secrets. In order to protect our secrets from any bad-actors we used [peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch@v2](https://github.com/peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch) so that only a maintainer would have the ability to run the E2E tests when a PR is submitted for review.

In the current version of Zarf (v0.15) images from registry1 are no longer needed to create the zarf-init-{{arch}}.tar.zst. This means, given our current span of E2E tests, we no longer need to use repository secrets when running tests. This gives us the ability to reassess the way we do our E2E testing.

When considering how to handle the tests, some of the important additions we were considering were:
  1. Ability to test against different kubernetes distributions
  2. Ability to test against different linux distributions
  3. Ability to run (at least some of) the E2E tests locally without relying on an ec2 instance - for quicker feedback loops when developing new features","## Decision

We will transition our E2E testing strategy to remove reliance on repository secrets by leveraging the updated initialization package that no longer requires registry1 images. This enables us to run E2E tests without secret access, improving security and developer experience.

Specifically, we will:

1. Remove the use of [peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch@v2] to restrict test execution only to maintainers, allowing tests to run automatically on all PRs.

2. Enhance our E2E test infrastructure to support testing across multiple Kubernetes distributions and Linux distributions. This will be achieved by parameterizing our test environments and leveraging containerized or virtualized environments that can simulate different OS and Kubernetes setups.

3. Develop capabilities to run a subset of E2E tests locally on developer machines without requiring an EC2 instance or cloud resources. This will provide faster feedback cycles during development and facilitate more iterative testing.

Together, these changes will improve security by eliminating secret exposures, increase test coverage over a broader range of environments, and speed up the development process with quicker test feedback loops.","## Decision

The previous E2E test code was not extensible enough to be reused to test Zarf against different kubernetes distributions. The test suite was refactored so that we could write a setup and teardown function for each kubernetes distribution we wanted to verify against and the test suite was then responsible for cycling through the different distributions. This gives us the ability to test multiple kubernetes distributions against the same exact test cases.

The individual test cases were also rewritten to not rely on terratest running a bash command over ssh. Instead, the test uses the locally built Zarf binary and example packages to validate expected behavior. This approach works both on local dev machines (linux/mac) and on the Ubuntu GitHub Runner that gets triggered when a pull request is created. This also has the positive side effect of not needing to wait several minutes for an ec2 instance to spin up for testing.

Since we no longer need repository secrets to run the E2E tests, we removed the requirement for a maintainer to use a `/test all` chatops command to dispatch the tests. Instead, there is a new test workflow defined for each kubernetes distribution we are verifying against and the tests get run automatically whenever a PR is created or updated.

When looking back at the list of 'important additions' we were considering above. All three are addressed with this approach. Testing against different kubernetes distributions is as simple as defining how to create and destroy the cluster. All of the test cases are runnable locally and then because of that testing on a linux distribution is possible by just switching over to another machine and running the same `make test-e2e` there. This also gives us the ability to test against cloud distributions like EKS! All you need is a valid kubeconfig and running `go test ./...` in the `./src/test/e2e` directory will run all of the test cases against the EKS cluster."
"## Context

In order to create any workloads in K8s, an image has to exist on the node or be pulled in from an OCI Distribution server (docker registry). Local K8s distros such as KIND, K3D, K3S, Microk8s have CLI support for injecting or pushing images into the CRIs of cluster nodes. No standard or tool exists to do this generically in K8s as the CRI sits outside the problem of K8s beyond just communicating with it. For Zarf to push images into a K8s cluster that does not have a CLI option to inject the image, we have to establish some mechanism to create a temporary registry, use an existing one, or inject the image in the cluster. Zarf must also support unknown environments with no other dependencies; we cannot assume a registry exists. Typically when K8s pulls images from a remote registry, it sends the request to the CRI that then does the pull outside of the K8s context. The CRI runs at the host level on a per-node basis, so to access a private registry, the TLS trust needs to be modified on any host/node that would attempt to pull the image. The two primary ways to do this are modifying the node's root certificate authorities or the CRIs configuration if it has an option for TLS root CA. Lastly, as this is per node, all nodes in the cluster would need to be modified or some affinity/taint to force the pod to use a single node during bootstrapping.","## Decision

To enable Zarf to push container images into Kubernetes clusters generically across diverse environments—especially those lacking native CLI support for image injection or any existing registries—we will implement an ephemeral, in-cluster container registry during the bootstrap process. This temporary registry will serve as an image distribution point accessible by all cluster nodes regardless of their environment.

Key points of this decision include:

1. **Ephemeral In-Cluster Registry**: Deploy a lightweight container registry inside the Kubernetes cluster temporarily during bootstrapping to host images needed for workloads.

2. **Cluster-Wide Accessibility**: Expose the registry via a ClusterIP Service so all nodes can reach it internally, avoiding the need for external network access or modifications on individual nodes.

3. **TLS Trust Management**: Since nodes need to trust the registry’s TLS certificate, Zarf will automate the injection of the registry’s CA certificate into all nodes’ trust stores or configure the container runtime’s TLS settings when possible. This may involve node-level configuration steps performed as part of the bootstrap.

4. **No Assumptions on Existing Infrastructure**: No dependency on external or pre-existing registries ensures compatibility with isolated or air-gapped clusters and unknown environments.

5. **Node Affinity or Taints**: Where TLS trust adjustments for all nodes are infeasible, Zarf may enforce pod scheduling affinities or taints to limit workload pods pulling images to trusted nodes.

6. **Cleanup after Bootstrapping**: The temporary registry will be removed once all images are distributed and workloads are deployed, maintaining cluster cleanliness.

This approach balances the need for universal compatibility without requiring cluster administrators to manually configure registries or trust stores, ensuring Zarf can reliably manage container images across any Kubernetes cluster environment.","## Decision

Because we cannot require third-party dependencies, the requirement from some cloud-managed or distro-managed registry is not an option as not every K8s cluster will have that available.  Running an in-memory registry while zarf is performing `zarf init` was initially explored to resolve the external dependency issue.  However, this solution proved too complex when dealing with network traversal (especially behind NATs), firewall, and NACL rulesets.  Additionally, because of the complexities around TLS trust, the in-memory registry was not a viable solution.

After iterating on several solutions, including `kubectl cp`, `kubectl exec`, a busybox configmap injection that brought in netcat to stream files, and a few variations on those ideas, we found using only configmaps to be the most predictable method for injection. The challenge with this mode is that the ETCD limit is 1 MB total, with binary data base64-encoded leaving roughly 670 KBs of data per configmap, far too small to bring the registry tarball in a single configmap. So instead, we used a combination of a custom Rust binary compiled with MUSL to perform file concatenation, untarring, and verification of a set of split tarball chunks across a variable number of configmaps. We found that chunking by less than the near-maximum configmap size was more performant on some resource-constrained control planes. The details of this solution and a drawing are located in the main README of this repo."
"## Context

SBOM are required for software running on government hardware per EO14028.","## Decision

We will integrate an automatic SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation process into our build pipeline to ensure compliance with EO14028 requirements for software running on government hardware. This will involve selecting a standardized SBOM format such as SPDX or CycloneDX and using compatible tools to generate and maintain an accurate and up-to-date SBOM for all software releases.","## Decision

Using Witness' Syft attestor functionality allows Zarf to continue to get more refined SBOM capabilities as Witness' capabilities expand over time. Syft is capable of finding installed packages and some binaries for statically compiled dependencies over each image within a Zarf package. This allows for SBOMs for each image to be generated and packaged along with the Zarf package.  Abilities to export the SBOM to SDPX and CycloneDX formatted documents as well as a browse-able web page are in works."
"## Context

Currently Zarf leverages [Helm Post Rendering](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/advanced/#post-rendering) to mutate image paths and secrets for K8s to use the internal [Zarf Registry](../packages/zarf-registry/). This works well for simple K8s deployments where Zarf is performing the actual manifest apply but fails when using a secondary gitops tools suchs as [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), etc. At that point, Zarf is unable to provide mutation and it is dependent on the package author to do the mutations themselves using rudimentary templating. Further, this issue also exists when for CRDs that references the [git server](../packages/gitea/). A `zarf prepare` command was added previously to make this less painful, but it still requires additional burden on package authors to do something we are able to prescribe in code.","## Decision

To improve mutation consistency and offload the burden from package authors, Zarf will introduce a dedicated mutation controller/operator that performs image path and secret mutations dynamically within the Kubernetes cluster. This operator will watch relevant Kubernetes resources (including Helm releases, CRDs, and any GitOps-managed manifests) and automatically rewrite image references and secrets to point to the internal Zarf Registry and Git server. This approach decouples mutation logic from Helm's post-rendering and integrates seamlessly with GitOps tools like Flux and ArgoCD, ensuring manifests are correctly mutated regardless of deployment method. The existing `zarf prepare` functionality will be deprecated in favor of this operator, simplifying package author responsibilities and improving consistency across all deployment scenarios.","## Decision

A [mutating webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/) is standard practice in K8s and there [are a lot of them](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#what-does-each-admission-controller-do). Using the normal Zarf component structure and deployment strategy we can leverage a mutating webhook to perform automatic imagePullSecret binding and image path updates as well as add additional as-needed mutations such as updating the [GitRepository](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/source/gitrepositories/) CRD with the appropriate secret and custom URL for the git server if someone is using Flux."
"## Context

In ADR 3, the decision was made to create a rust binary (`stage1`) that would re-assemble a `registry:2` image and a go registry binary (`stage2`) from a series of configmaps. While this solution works, it is overkill for the operations that `stage2` performs. The `stage2` binary is only responsible for 1. starting a docker registry in `rw` mode, 2. pushing the `registry:2` crane tarball into said registry, 3. starting the docker registry in `r` mode. This `registry:2` image is then immediately consumed by the `zarf-registry` package, creating a true in-cluster docker registry. The injector pod is then destroyed. The overhead this operation creates:

- having to keep track of another binary (making the total number 3 for the zarf ecosystem)
- nearly doubling the amount of configmaps loaded into the cluster (makes init slower)
- having to compile the binary for each platform (adds to the build time + ci)
- using a full-featured docker registry to host a single image (wasteful)","## Decision

We will replace the current two-stage binary approach (`stage1` and `stage2`) with a simplified scripting solution that leverages lightweight container tools and Kubernetes primitives. Specifically, instead of using a dedicated Rust binary to reassemble images and a Go binary to manage the registry lifecycle, we will:

1. Use a minimal Kubernetes init container or job that uses standard container tooling (e.g., `crane`, `skopeo`, or `ctr`) to push the `registry:2` image tarball directly into a lightweight, ephemeral registry instance.

2. Start the docker registry in read-write mode temporarily to accept the pushed image, then restart it in read-only mode.

3. Remove the `stage1` and `stage2` binaries from the project to reduce build complexity, CI overhead, and runtime resource consumption.

This decision eliminates the need for maintaining additional custom binaries, reduces the number of required configmaps, speeds up initialization, and leverages existing container tools and the registry image more efficiently without unnecessary complexity.","## Decision

The rust binary is already being injected via configmap and unpacking the tarball. There is little need to bring everything but the kitchen sink to just serve a single image. Therefore the decision is to use the rust binary to perform the entire injection process. This required a few changes to the rust binary:

- not only re-assemble + unpack the tarball, but also unpack the `registry:2` image (stored as a [crane tarball format](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/pkg/v1/tarball))
- transform the `registry:2` crane manifest to a docker v2 manifest
- spin up an HTTP server compliant with the v2 docker registry API to serve the `registry:2` image"
"## Context

There are sections of the code that are not easily able to be tested by our end-to-end testing and now that Zarf is moving into being a library for other products there will be more scrutiny around our defined interfaces.  This ADR explores ways that we could adjust our testing strategy to address these concerns.

Potential considerations:

1. Introduce Unit-Testing Zarf-wide
    Pros:
        - More of the codebase is covered with tests and will force us to take more consideration when updating it
    Cons:
        - As the codebase evolves the efficacy of these tests is likely to go down, especially if they are written to the code rather than the interface

2. Introduce Unit Testing in a defined and limited capacity within Zarf
    Pros:
        - A decent amount of the codebase will be tested (specifically we can target those areas difficult to e2e test)
        - We can be picky about what/where we unit test so that the maintenance burden of the tests is not too high
    Cons:
        - We will need to be vigilant when PRs come through with Unit Tests that these are correct applications of them

3. Introduce Integration Testing or partial End-to-End testing
    Pros:
        - This is closer to how we already test within Zarf
    Cons:
        - These can be relatively complex to orchestrate and maintain over time requiring complex mocks or other mechanisms to make them work","## Decision

We will adopt a targeted unit testing strategy within Zarf focused on areas that are difficult to cover with end-to-end tests. This approach balances the need to improve test coverage and interface scrutiny, while keeping the maintenance burden manageable.

Specifically, we will:

- Introduce unit tests selectively for key modules and interfaces that are hard to test via end-to-end or integration tests.
- Enforce code review processes to ensure unit tests are appropriate, correctly scoped, and maintainable.
- Continue to leverage existing end-to-end and integration tests for broader workflow validation.
- Periodically review and adjust the scope of unit tests based on evolving code complexity and test efficacy.

This decision provides a pragmatic middle ground that enhances confidence in Zarf’s interfaces as it transitions to a library consumption model without overwhelming the team with excessive test maintenance.","## Decision

It was decided to introduce a limited set of unit tests to the Zarf codebase (2) because this will enable us the most flexibility and control over how we test while also allowing us to specifically target specific units without a ton of overhead.  Specifically we will ask the following before implementing a Unit Test:

1. Is what I want to test a true unit (i.e. a single function or file)?
2. Does what I want to test have a clearly defined interface (i.e. a public specification)?
3. Is this code inside of the `src/pkg` folder or should it be?"
"## Context

Images are not the only way that dependencies can be brought in via a Zarf package (our own init package has two components that are not images yet could have vulnerabilities within them, k3s and the injector).  We should SBOM these in addition to images so that we are providing a more complete picture to our users.

Potential considerations:

1. Run Syft against the entire zarf temp build directory
    Pros:
        - This would provide the most information for what _might_ be in a Zarf package
    Cons:
        - If git repos are brought in you could catch many index files that are actually not in the package but are dependencies of the repos leading to confusion

2. Run Syft against files and dataInjections
    Pros:
        - We know these files are actually inside of the package and won't just be noise
        - This is the most common two ways for people to include additional artifacts in packages (we use files in our own init package)
    Cons:
        - This is only a subset of what Zarf provides and someone could commit an artifact to a git repo for example

3. Allow user flexibility in what gets SBOMed
    Pros:
        - This provides the user the most flexibility
    Cons:
        - This could be complex to get right on implementation and if it were optional may be a forgotten feature by most users","## Decision

We will run Syft against the files and data injections included explicitly within the Zarf package (option 2). This approach balances completeness and accuracy by focusing on artifacts we know are definitely packaged, avoiding noise from indirect dependencies like git repo contents. While it does not cover every possible source of dependencies, it provides meaningful SBOM coverage for the most common use cases, including our own init package components. 

Additionally, to address edge cases and advanced needs, we will design the system to be extensible, allowing the option to run SBOM generation on broader scopes (such as the entire build directory) as an advanced feature or future enhancement, rather than default behavior. This keeps the default user experience straightforward while leaving room for flexibility and customization.","## Decision

It was decided that we would SBOM the files and dataInjections inclusions by component (2) and include them into our SBOM viewer that way.  This will allow us to characterize what SBOMing in Zarf may look like going forward without introducing something that is just optional or that might make too much noise at first blush."
"## Context

Zarf was rooted in the idea of declarative K8s deployments for disconnected environments. Many of the design decisions made in Zarf are based on this idea. However, in certain connected environments, Zarf can still be leveraged as a way to define declarative deployments and upgrades without the constraints of disconnected environments. To that end, providing a declarative way to deploy Zarf packages without the need for a Zarf init package would be useful in such environments.","## Decision

We will introduce support for declarative Zarf package deployments that do not require an initial Zarf init package in connected environments. This enhancement will allow users in connected environments to leverage Zarf’s declarative deployment and upgrade capabilities more seamlessly, without the overhead or prerequisite of deploying an init package. The system will detect the environment connectivity and enable this mode accordingly, ensuring backward compatibility and maintaining the current workflows for disconnected use cases. This decision aligns with extending Zarf’s flexibility while preserving its core design principles focused on declarative Kubernetes deployments.","## Decision

YOLO mode is an optional boolean config set in the `metadata` section of the Zarf package manifest. Setting `metadata.yolo=true` will deploy the Zarf package ""as is"" without needing the Zarf state to exist or the Zarf Agent mutating webhook. Zarf packages with YOLO mode enabled are not allowed to specify components with container images or Git repos and validation will prevent the package from being created."
"## Context

Originally, the `scripts` noun was added to components to allow us to move hard-coded init business logic out of the codebase and into the package system. At the time there was only a `before` and `after` section with simply an array entry per command. Later, `prepare` was added as a way to do something during `zarf package create`. As teams began to find new ways to use the capabilities, their limitations became more obvious.","## Decision

To address the limitations of the original `scripts` implementation, we will refactor the `scripts` noun to support a more flexible and expressive structure. This will include:

- Expanding script phases beyond just `before`, `prepare`, and `after` to allow for additional lifecycle hooks as needed.
- Allowing script entries to be more than simple array strings; for example, supporting objects that can specify execution conditions, environment variables, or execution order.
- Providing documentation and examples to guide teams on how to leverage these new capabilities effectively.
- Ensuring backward compatibility by supporting the original array-based scripts alongside the new format during a transition period.

This approach will enable teams to encapsulate complex initialization and preparation logic within packages while maintaining clarity, flexibility, and maintainability.","## Decision

The `scripts` section of the `zarf.yaml` will be replaced with a new `actions` section. The `actions` section will be a map of action names to a list of commands to run. `actions` will contain `action sets` that map to the following lifecycle events:

- `onCreate` - Runs during `zarf package create`
- `onDeploy` - Runs during `zarf package deploy`
- `onRemove` - Runs during `zarf package remove`

In addition to adding more lifecycle events, the `actions` section will also allow for more complex actions to be defined. New configurations include, setting the cmd directory, defining custom env variables, setting the number of retries, setting the max total seconds, muting the output, and [setting a variable](../docs/3-create-a-zarf-package/7-component-actions.md#creating-dynamic-variables-from-actions) to be used in other actions or components.

Further details can be found in the `component-actions` [component actions documentation](../docs/3-create-a-zarf-package/7-component-actions.md), [package create lifecycle documentation](../docs/3-create-a-zarf-package/5-package-create-lifecycle.md), [package deploy lifecycle documentation](../docs/4-deploy-a-zarf-package/1-package-deploy-lifecycle.md), and the [example package](../examples/component-actions/README.md)."
"## Context

There has been a long-standing usability gap with Zarf when doing local development due to a lack of local image support. A solution was merged in, [#1173](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/pull/1173), and released in [v0.23.4](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/releases/tag/v0.23.4) to support this feature. Unfortunately, we didn't realize there is a [glaring issue](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/1214) with the implementation that causes Zarf to crash when trying to load large images into the local docker daemon.  The docker daemon support in Crane is somewhat naive and can send a machine into an OOM condition due to how the tar stream is loaded into memory from the docker save action. Crane does have an option to avoid this issue, but at the cost of being much slower to load images from docker.

We did extensive investigation into various strategies of loading docker images from the daemon including: crane, skopeo, the docker go client and executing the docker cli directly with varying levels of success. Unfortunately, some of the methods that did work well were up to 3 times slower than the current implementation, though they avoided the OOM issue. Lastly, the docker daemon save operations directly still ended up being slower than crane and docker produced a legacy format that would cause issues with [future package schema changes](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/1319) we are planning for oci imports.

| 20 GB Single-Layer Image (local registry + cached) | 5m 2s      | 2m 10s    |","## Decision

To address the local image loading issue without causing OOM crashes, we will adopt a hybrid approach for local Docker image loading in Zarf:

1. **Default to Crane with OOM-safe mode enabled:**  
   Use Crane’s option that avoids loading the entire tar stream into memory at once, preventing OOM crashes. Although this mode is slower, it ensures stability when loading large images.

2. **Introduce an explicit user-configurable flag to toggle performance vs stability:**  
   Allow advanced users to disable the OOM-safe mode in Crane to gain better performance at the risk of potential memory exhaustion, useful for smaller images or systems with ample memory.

3. **Plan to refactor image import logic for future OCI schema compatibility:**  
   Avoid using legacy Docker save/load formats that conflict with planned OCI import features. Invest in updating the image loading mechanism to support OCI standards natively.

4. **Document the trade-offs thoroughly:**  
   Clearly communicate the performance and memory usage implications of each approach, so users can make informed decisions during local development.

This decision balances stability and usability, resolves the crashing issue for large images, and positions Zarf for future OCI schema enhancements.","## Decision

We had hoped to leverage docker caching and avoid crane caching more, but realized that caching was still occurring via Syft for SBOM. Additionally, the extremely-large, local-only image is actually the edge case here and we created a recommended workaround in the FAQs as well as an inline alert when a large docker image is detected. This restores behavior to what it was before the docker daemon support was added, but with the added benefit of being able to load images from the docker daemon when they are available locally."
"## Context

One primary application component that end users of Zarf are deploying is [Big Bang](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang). The installation of Big Bang is complicated for several reasons:

- It requires Flux to be installed to deploy correctly due to the use of Flux CRDs.
- The [images](https://umbrella-bigbang-releases.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/umbrella/1.51.0/package-images.yaml) defined within Big Bang are normally a superset of the images needed for any individual deployment.
- All images that Big Bang might need takes 10s of gigabytes of storage to include in a Zarf package.
- The git repositories defined within Big Bang are normally a superset of the git repositories needed for any individual deployment.
- Injecting a `values.yaml` file into the [default deployment structure](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/blob/master/base/kustomization.yaml) is complicated and the discovery of which images are needed is a function of the values that are provided to the Big Bang chart","## Decision

To effectively manage the complexity and resource demands of deploying Big Bang within Zarf, we will implement a dynamic, values-driven packaging approach as follows:

1. **Dependency Management:** Bundle Flux installation as a prerequisite or integrate an automated installation step within the Zarf Big Bang deployment process to ensure Flux CRDs are present prior to Big Bang deployment.

2. **Selective Image Inclusion:** Instead of packaging the entire superset of Big Bang images, parse the user-provided `values.yaml` to determine exactly which components and consequently which images are needed. Use this information to curate a minimal image set for inclusion, drastically reducing storage requirements.

3. **Selective Git Repository Inclusion:** Similarly, determine which git repositories are necessary based on the deployment values and include only those repositories within the package.

4. **Values Injection Automation:** Develop tooling or scripts within Zarf to automate the injection of the user’s `values.yaml` into the Big Bang deployment structure (kustomization.yaml and related manifests). This automation will handle the complexity of overlaying values and discovering dependent resources.

5. **User Guidance and Templates:** Provide clear guidance and templates for users to define their `values.yaml`, helping them specify only what is needed for their deployment, thereby optimizing package size and installation complexity.

By adopting this approach, the Big Bang deployments through Zarf will be more storage efficient, flexible, and manageable without overwhelming users with manual complexity or excessive resource requirements.","## Decision

Deployments of Big Bang can be managed with a new `bigbang` noun in the zarf.yaml that manages the complexity of the deployment. This capability will take the values provided to the big bang chart, template them during the package phase to identify which [Big Bang packages](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/blob/master/docs/packages.md) are being configured in the Zarf package. The code then includes only the git repositories and images needed for the configured packages, and does not include the git repositories and images for packages that would not be deployed.

The `bigbang` section will provide the following configurations for managing a big bang deployment:

- `version` - Identifies the particular version of Big Bang to deploy, which corresponds to git tags in the provided `repo`. See versions of Big Bang [here](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/releases).
- `repo` - Identifies the git repository Big Bang is hosted on. Defaults to https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang.git
- `valuesFiles` - list of local files that get passed to the Big Bang helm chart for deployment.
- `skipFlux` - boolean to determine if the flux installation for Big Bang should be skipped. Only set this to true if flux has been deployed in a different way already in the cluster."
"## Context

Zarf packages are currently only available if built locally or through manual file transfers. This is not a scalable way to distribute packages. We wanted to find a way to distribute and publish packages in a way that is easily consumable for the majority of users. When considering the goal of being able to share packages, security and trust are very important considerations. We wanted our publishing solution and architecture changes to keep in mind signing of packages and the ability to verify the integrity of packages.

We know we are successful when:

1. (Priority) Users can use Zarf to natively publish a Zarf package to an OCI compliant registry
2. (Secondary goal) Package creators can sign Zarf packages to enable package deployers can trust a packages supply chain security","## Decision

We will adopt OCI (Open Container Initiative) compliant registries as the primary distribution mechanism for Zarf packages. This approach leverages widely adopted container registry infrastructure to publish, version, and distribute packages seamlessly.

To address security and trust, we will integrate package signing into the Zarf packaging and publishing workflow. Package creators will sign their Zarf packages cryptographically before publishing to the OCI registry. On the consuming side, Zarf will verify the signatures of packages retrieved from the registry to ensure integrity and authenticity.

By using OCI registries for distribution combined with signing and verification of packages, we provide a scalable, secure, and user-friendly package publishing ecosystem that meets both our priority and secondary goals.","## Decision

We decided that changing the structure of Zarf packages to be an OCI artifact would be the best way to distribute and publish packages as registries are already an integral part of the container ecosystem."
"## Context

Zarf currently supports git servers and container registries within the airgap to host dependencies for applications, and while this works well for most production deployments, it doesn't cater as well to airgap development where you may need artifacts and libraries for various coding languages to compile and develop software.  Zarf's support of `git` is also somewhat lacking in that it only supports flux `GitRepository` objects and does not support more generic use cases where clients try to reach out to upstream `git` hosts in a more native way.","## Decision

To better support airgap development workflows and improve git integration, Zarf will be extended to include native support for common language-specific artifact repositories (such as npm, PyPI, Maven, etc.) within the airgap environment. Additionally, the git support will be enhanced by broadening compatibility beyond flux `GitRepository` objects to support more generic git operations and protocols, enabling clients to interact with upstream git hosts more naturally. This will involve implementing a more flexible git proxy or mirror service within the airgap that can handle standard git commands and fetch operations, thereby improving both development convenience and production parity in airgap environments.","## Decision

Since we already had an artifact registry available to us in Gitea, it was decided to utilize that as the default provider for this functionality in addition to matching the external support for `git` and `registry` servers with a new `artifact` server specification on `init`.  From here, to access the configured server we had two main options:

1. Transform any artifact references statically (i.e. swap upstream URLs in build scripts before bringing them into the environment)
2. Transform any artifact references dynamically (i.e. swap upstream URLs in an active proxy that any build scripts could pickup through DNS)

It was decided to go with #2 since this would allow us to support a wider array of build technologies (including those that wrap existing commands like Buck/Bazel/Make) as well as support builds that may be coming from resources not brought in by Zarf.  This allows for more flexibility in how Zarf could transform URLs while allowing these commands to run as they would on the internet side without any modification."
"## Context

Eventually, Zarf needs to become a ""Generally Available"" v1.x.x product that people can rely on for mission-critical operations.  Today, Zarf can be used in these environments; though, it requires someone more involved in the Zarf lifecycle than a normal consumer/user to make that successful due to the regular introduction of breaking changes and the lack of testing in certain areas.","## Decision

To achieve a stable, generally available v1.x.x release suitable for mission-critical environments, we will implement a comprehensive versioning and release strategy centered on semantic versioning with strict backward compatibility guarantees for all minor and patch releases. We will introduce a robust automated testing framework covering critical paths and integrations to prevent regressions and detect issues early. Breaking changes will be restricted to major version increments and will be communicated clearly and well in advance, along with detailed migration guides. Additionally, we will establish a formal release management process including release candidates and prolonged beta testing phases involving real users to gather feedback and ensure reliability before GA. This approach reduces the burden on users to manage lifecycle changes and increases confidence in Zarf's stability for production use.","## Decision

To make Zarf a Generally Available product we need to focus on overall stability and mechanisms to ensure long-term stability.  ""Stability,"" in this case, is both that of the features we release and of the APIs and schemas we present to Zarf consumers.

To increase this stability, we decided to implement the following:

- [ ] Mechanism/branching strategy to backport patch fixes to older minor releases
- [x] Clear definition of `released`, `beta`, and `alpha` features, including a matrix of their support across OSes
- [ ] Clear definition of when backward compatibility checks are going to be removed with clear messaging to users
- [ ] End to End testing that covers the `released` features outlined in that feature matrix - this should also be done:
  - across operating systems (specifically: Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - across major k8s distros (specifically: K3d, K3s, Minikube, Kind, EKS, AKS, OpenShift)
  - across registry providers (specifically: Docker Distribution, ECR, ACR)
  - across git providers (specifically: Gitea, GitLab)
- [ ] Unit testing that covers our library code (`src/pkg`) for people using Zarf as a library (code coverage metric TBD)
- [ ] Mechanisms and tests to not break compatibility with packages built with older versions of Zarf
- [ ] Mechanisms to notify users when they may need to upgrade the Zarf Agent (or Pepr capability)
- [ ] Mechanisms to ensure users can easily access documentation specific to the version of Zarf they use
- [ ] Mechanisms to ensure a more seamless Zarf install experience (i.e., macOS binary signing, `sudo apk add zarf`, `asdf install zarf X.X.X`)
- [ ] Regularly published/maintained example package(s) for tutorials/quick install
- [ ] Clear definition/strategy for ""what Zarf is"" including clear docs on how to use `released` features

"## Context

The idea of `hooks` is to provide a way for cluster maintainers to register functionality that runs during the deployment lifecycle. Zarf packages already have the concept of `actions` that can execute commands on the host machine's shell during certain package lifecycle events. As `actions` gain more adoption, the team has noticed they are being used to add functionality to Zarf in unexpected ways. We want `actions` to be a tool that extends upon the functionality of Zarf and its packages, not a tool that works around missing or clunky functionality.

We want package creators to be able to create system agnostic packages by leveraging core Zarf functionality. The following is one such scenario:

- _IF_ ECR is chosen as the external registry during `zarf init` / cluster creation, _THEN_ Zarf will seamlessly leverage ECR without requiring advanced user effort.

Using ECR as a remote registry creates 2 problems that Zarf will need to solve:

 1. ECR authentication tokens expire after 12 hours and need to be refreshed. This means the cluster will need to constantly be refreshing its tokens and the user deploying packages will need to make sure they have a valid token.
 2. ECR Image Repositories do not support 'push-to-create'. This means we will need to explicitly create an image repository for every image that is being pushed within the Zarf package.

Packages that get deployed onto a cluster initialized with ECR as its remote registry will need to make sure it solves these 2 problems.

Currently there are 2 solutions:

1. The package deployer solves the problem pre-deployment (creating needed repos, secrets, etc...)
2. The package itself solves these problems with `actions` that are custom built for ECR clusters.

Neither one of these current solutions are ideal. We don't want to require overly complex external + prior actions for Zarf package deployments, and we don't want package creators to have to create and distribute packages that are specific to ECR.

Potential considerations:","# Decision

Introduce a first-class `hooks` system within Zarf that extends the deployment lifecycle with core, system-aware functionality, separate from user-defined `actions`. `Hooks` will enable Zarf to embed needed operational logic—such as ECR authentication token refreshes and repository creation—transparently when a cluster is initialized with ECR, without requiring package maintainers to tailor packages for ECR. This will allow packages to remain system agnostic, relying on the cluster to handle environment-specific concerns via `hooks`. 

Specifically:

- `Hooks` will be managed by the cluster/zarf core and execute automatically at defined lifecycle phases.
- Core hooks for ECR will handle authentication token refresh and image repository creation as part of deployment.
- `Actions` remain as user-defined extension points for custom shell commands within packages and should not be repurposed for system-level concerns.
- This separation clarifies responsibility, reduces duplication or complex pre-deployment steps, and improves package portability and maintainability.

This approach aligns with the architectural goals of clear separation of concerns, improved user experience, and scalable, reusable cluster lifecycle management.","## Decision

[Pepr](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/pepr) will be used to enable custom, or environment-specific, automation tasks to be integrated in the Zarf package deployment lifecycle. Pepr also allows the Zarf codebase to remain agnostic to any third-party APIs or dependencies that may be used.

A `--skip-webhooks` flag has been added to `zarf package deploy` to allow users to opt out of Zarf checking and waiting for any webhooks to complete during package deployments."
"## Context

We need a way to decouple transformations from Zarf. We know the Zarf transformation library is battle tested, hardened, and reliable. As Pepr takes admission responsibilities from the Zarf Agent, we need a way to synchronize the TypeScript with the Go code instead of maintaining two disparate libraries which will be expected to grow.

We considered:

- WASM
- gRPC
- REST
- Rewrite the code in TypeScript","## Decision

We will adopt a gRPC-based approach to synchronize and reuse the Zarf transformation library between Go and TypeScript. Specifically, the battle-tested Go library will remain the single source of truth for transformations, and we will expose its functionality via a gRPC service.

The TypeScript Pepr component will act as a gRPC client, invoking transformation operations remotely. This approach avoids code duplication and divergence, preserves the reliability of the existing Go implementation, and provides a well-defined, performant, and type-safe communication layer between the two components.

We ruled out WASM due to complexity and maturity concerns for integrating the Go transformation code as a WebAssembly module in the TypeScript environment. REST was dismissed for its less strict typing and potential overhead compared to gRPC. A full rewrite into TypeScript was considered too expensive and risk-prone given the proven stability of the existing Go library.

This decision aligns with our goals to maintain a single, reliable codebase for transformations, enable clean separation of concerns, and prepare for evolving product needs with a scalable, language-agnostic interface.","## Decision

We conformed around using WASM because we can leverage the battle tested transform library from Zarf without incurring network overhead cost from pod to pod or container to container communications."
"## Context

Zarf natively supports creating the following package sources:

- Local Tarball (`.tar` and `.tar.zst`)
  - Via `zarf package create <dir> -o <dir>`, with compression determined by `metadata.uncompressed` in `zarf.yaml`
- Split Tarball (`.part...`)
  - Via `zarf package create <dir> --max-package-size <size> -o <dir>`
- OCI package (`oci://`)
  - Via `zarf package publish <source> oci://` or `zarf package create <dir> -o oci://...`
- In-cluster (Deployed) package
  - Post `zarf package deploy <source>` the package is show in `zarf package list`

However, the current loading abilities of Zarf have been inconsistent depending upon the action specified. For example:

- Split tarball packages could be created, deployed, but not inspected, or removed
- In-cluster packages could be removed (by name), but not inspected
- HTTPs URLs could be deployed, but not inspected, or removed
- etc...","## Decision

To ensure a consistent and unified user experience, Zarf will standardize package loading and management operations across all supported package source types. This includes implementing uniform support for inspection, listing, deployment, and removal actions regardless of package format or location.

Concretely, the following decisions are made:

- Extend the package loading subsystem to abstract over package source types (local tarballs, split tarballs, OCI packages, in-cluster packages, HTTP(s) URLs) so that all operations (create, inspect, deploy, remove, list) are supported consistently.
- Refactor commands like `zarf package inspect`, `zarf package remove`, and `zarf package list` to operate seamlessly across all package formats.
- Introduce necessary backend support (e.g., indexing in-cluster deployed packages for inspection, handling split tarballs metadata for removal) to enable this functionality.
- Document these capabilities clearly to set user expectations and encourage adoption of all package sources interchangeably.

This decision aligns with Zarf’s goal of being a flexible, robust package management tool suitable for multiple deployment scenarios.","## Decision

Zarf must support the `deploy`, `inspect`, `remove`, `publish`, `pull`, and `mirror-resources` commands across package sources.

For common behavior to be exhibited by all sources, the `PackageSource` interface has been introduced along with the `layout` library.

```go
// src/pkg/packager/sources/new.go

// PackageSource is an interface for package sources.
//
// While this interface defines three functions, LoadPackage, LoadPackageMetadata, and Collect; only one of them should be used within a packager function.
//
// These functions currently do not promise repeatability due to the side effect nature of loading a package.
type PackageSource interface {
    // LoadPackage loads a package from a source.
    //
    // For the default sources included in Zarf, package integrity (checksums, signatures, etc.) is validated during this function
    // and expects the package structure to follow the default Zarf package structure.
    //
    // If your package does not follow the default Zarf package structure, you will need to implement your own source.
    LoadPackage(*layout.PackagePaths) error
    // LoadPackageMetadata loads a package's metadata from a source.
    //
    // This function follows the same principles as LoadPackage, with a few exceptions:
    //
    // - Package integrity validation will display a warning instead of returning an error if
    //   the package is signed but no public key is provided. This is to allow for the inspection and removal of packages
    //   that are signed but the user does not have the public key for.
    LoadPackageMetadata(dst *layout.PackagePaths, wantSBOM bool, skipValidation bool) error

    // Collect relocates a package from its source to a tarball in a given destination directory.
    Collect(destinationDirectory string) (tarball string, err error)
}
```

The following sources have been implemented:

- Local Tarball (`.tar` and `.tar.zst`)
- Split Tarball (`.part...`)
- HTTP(S) URL
- Published OCI package (`oci://`)
- In-cluster (Deployed) package (`inspect` and `remove` only)

The `layout` library contains the `PackagePaths` struct which supersedes the prior `TempPaths` struct. This new struct contains access methods to different aspects of Zarf's internal package layout. This struct is passed to the `PackageSource` functions to allow for the loading of packages into the correct layout. In order for a package to be loaded into the correct layout, the package must follow the default Zarf package structure, or be converted to the expected structure during loading operations."
"## Context

Zarf has supports composing components together between packages on `zarf package create` since v0.16.0.  This has allowed package creators to make more complex packages from smaller reusable bits.  As this functionality grew however there were a few problems that developed:

1. Import chains did not handle scaling to larger numbers of layers with test coverage usually only covering the first import.
2. When OCI skeletons were added they were largely bolted on after the fact without rethinking how they would impact composability.
3. Component filtering via the `only` filter was not implemented in a central location leading to bugs with create-time filters.","## Decision

We will refactor the package composition and import system to create a centralized, scalable, and extensible architecture for component composition in Zarf. This new design will:

1. Implement a unified import resolution mechanism that handles deep import chains efficiently, ensuring full test coverage across all import layers.
2. Integrate OCI skeleton handling natively within the composition logic, rather than as an afterthought, to maintain composability and consistency.
3. Centralize component filtering logic, particularly the `only` filter, within the core import and composition system to eliminate create-time filter bugs.

This approach will improve maintainability, scalability, and correctness of package composition as Zarf grows in complexity.","## Decision

We decided to separate composability into its own package that represents a composability import chain as a doubly linked list.  This allows us to represent the whole chain as it exists relative to the ""head"" Zarf package (the definition that Zarf was asked to build) to more easily handle packages that are in different locations (such as OCI skeletons in one's cache).  We also run the compose functions on all components so that the additional filter logic that is needed for these components can be handled more concisely and built upon (as it might for `flavor` https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/2101)."
"## Context

> Feature request: <https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/2169>

The current package development lifecycle is:

1. Create a `zarf.yaml` file and add components
2. Create a package with `zarf package create <dir>`
3. Debug any create errors and resolve by editing `zarf.yaml` and repeating step 2
4. Run `zarf init` to initialize the cluster
5. Deploy the package with `zarf package deploy <tarball>`
6. Debug any deploy errors and resolve by editing `zarf.yaml` and repeating step 2 or 5

If there are deployment errors, the common pattern is to reset the cluster (ex: `k3d cluster delete && k3d cluster create`) and repeat steps 4-6. Re-initializing the cluster, recreating the package, and redeploying the package is tedious and time consuming; especially when the package is large or the change was small.

`zarf package create` is designed around air-gapped environments where the package is created in one environment and deployed in another. Due to this architecture, a package's dependencies _must_ be retrieved and assembled _each_ and _every_ time.

There already exists the concept of [`YOLO` mode](0010-yolo-mode.md), which can build + deploy a package without the need for `zarf init`, and builds without fetching certain heavy dependencies (like Docker images). However, `YOLO` mode is not exposed via CLI flags, and is meant to develop and deploy packages in fully connected environments.","## Decision

Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--dev` or `--fast-build`) for `zarf package create` that enables a development mode optimized for iterative package creation and deployment. In this mode, the package creation process will:

- Cache and reuse previously fetched dependencies and artifacts to avoid redundant downloads and builds.
- Skip full cluster initialization and heavy dependency retrieval steps.
- Facilitate faster package rebuilds by only updating changed components.
- Allow direct deployment to a connected cluster without requiring `zarf init` between deploys.

This development mode will be explicitly documented and intended for use in connected environments to speed up the package development lifecycle, complementing but not replacing the existing air-gap focused workflow. It will build upon and expose the concept of the existing YOLO mode with clearer CLI flags and controls.

By implementing this, developers can rapidly iterate on package creation and deployment cycles without the heavy overhead of full cluster resets and package rebuilds, significantly improving developer productivity while maintaining the integrity and design philosophy of Zarf’s air-gapped packaging system.","## Decision

Introduce a `dev deploy` command that will combine the lifecycle of `package create` and `package deploy` into a single command. This command will:

- Not result in a re-usable tarball / OCI artifact
- Not have any interactive prompts
- Not require `zarf init` to be run by default (override-able with a CLI flag)
- Be able to create+deploy a package in either YOLO mode (default) or prod mode (exposed via a CLI flag)
- Only build + deploy components that _will_ be deployed (contrasting with `package create` which builds _all_ components regardless of whether they will be deployed)"

"## Context

Zarf is currently using an in-house built logging solution which in turn depends on pterm. This solution is used to output information to the end user who is using the Zarf CLI. This output is for the most part formatted with the purpose of CLI user experience. Logging function calls are done both in the CLI specific code as well as in the packages. The logging is implemented in such a way that different levels exist with different impacts and log destinations. A common pattern that is used is to call `message.Fatal` whenever an error occurs. This will output the message to STDERR while writing the actual error message to a debug log and exiting the program. Exiting the program in this manner makes unit testing difficult while also skipping proper context handling and skipping any clean-up that was intended to run before exiting the program. Some logging components like the progress bar and spinner are accessed through a shared global state that is not thread safe. The coupling to logging becomes complicated as disabling the progress bar is a challenge while multi threading these functions which access the global state resulting in complicated access patterns.","## Decision

We will refactor the current logging solution to adopt a structured, context-aware logging framework that decouples logging from program control flow and global state dependencies. Specifically:

1. Replace the in-house logging functions like `message.Fatal` with logger calls that return errors or propagate them up the call stack instead of exiting the program directly. This will allow proper context handling, clean-up execution, and improve testability.

2. Integrate a thread-safe logging library or introduce synchronization around logging components (including progress bars and spinners) to avoid unsafe global shared state, enabling safe concurrent logging and progress updates.

3. Separate CLI-formatted output from internal logs by distinguishing user-facing messages (e.g., informational or error messages intended for CLI display) from debug and trace logs, so that logging behavior can be controlled independently from UI elements.

4. Introduce dependency injection or context parameters for logger instances, allowing packages and CLI code to log through injected, configurable loggers rather than a global logger, improving modularity and testability.

By undertaking these changes, we ensure a clean, testable, and thread-safe logging system suited for CLI usage without compromising proper error handling and program flow.","## Decision

I am proposing to completely refactor the logging functionality to follow a more standardized format using the newish slog interfaces. On top of that we would refactor the current internationalization by converting them to standardized errors.

* Replace the message package with a slog interface.
* Replace the lang package with static errors.
* Remove any use of `message.Fatal` and instead return errors.
* Refactor use of `message.WarnErr` to either return error or to log the error.
* Refactor existing functions that print formatted outputs to defer the printing to the CLI.
* Define a new interface for spinner and progress bar that is passed in as a function parameter.

The message package currently exports the following functions which should be replaced by its logr counterpart.

| Function | Replacement | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ZarfCommand | Info | Just formats a slice as a command. |
| Command | Info | Outputs a command with a prefix and style. |
| Debug | Debug | |
| Debugf | Debug | |
| ErrorWebf | N/A | Not used anywhere. |
| Warn | Warn | |
| Warnf | Warn | |
| WarnErr | Warn | |

| Fatal | N/A | Should not be used. |
| Fatalf | N/A | Should not be used. |
| Info | Info | |
| Infof | Info | |
| Success | Info | Seems to be a info log with a checkmark prefix. |
| Successf | Info | Seems to be a info log with a checkmark prefix. |
| Question | ? | Open question how to resolve this. |
| Questionf | ? | Open question how to resolve this. |
| Note | Info | Should just be an info or maybe a debug log. |
| Notef | Info | Should just be an info or maybe a debug log. |
| Title | ? | Not sure how this should be replaced as it formats with separator. |
| HeaderInfof | ? | |
| HorizontalRule | ? | |
| JSONValue | N/A | Should be replaced with a marshal. |
| Paragraph | ? | |
| Paragraphn | ? | |
| PrintDiff | ? | |
| Table | ? | Need to come up with a good syntax for functions to return output that can print as a table. |
| ColorWrap | ? | Should this be used? | 
| PrintConnectStringTable | N/A | This logic should not exist in the message package. |
| PrintCredentialTable | N/A | This logic should not exist in the message package. |
| PrintComponentCredential | N/A | This logic should not exist in the message package. |
| PrintCredentialUpdates | N/A | This logic should not exist in the message package. |
| Spinner | Interface | New Spinner interface. |
| ProgressBar | Interface | New progress bar interface. |

The majority of simple logging changes should be possible with little signature changes. Replacing the existing output with a slog interface would allow other implementations to be used. A challenge initially may be the changes to table output formatting to make it work properly. This change will require some refactoring of existing code. A requirement for the changes is that they have to improve the UX for users looking at log files. As I understand the present day the spinners will cause a new line everytime they update, resulting in a lot of bloat. A goal should be to make sure that this does not happen in the future.

Spinners and progress bars however are a bit more challenging. They need to be refactored so that they are no longer instantiated outside of the CLI code. They should instead be passed as a function parameter to each function that needs them. A good example of a project that solves the problem in a similar manner is Kind. In Kind they create a [status object from the logger](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/blob/7799e72306db315ea4f4b1cac90ff68404da4f28/pkg/internal/cli/status.go#L39) which they then [pass to where it is needed](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/blob/7799e72306db315ea4f4b1cac90ff68404da4f28/pkg/cluster/internal/create/create.go#L133). Doing so results in a single status object created which is reused where ever it is needed. A lot of inspiration can be take from how Kind deals with CLI output. While they use klog instead of slog there are a lot of similarities. They have for example a check if the output is in a terminal or not, and will disable the spinner accordingly. 

Here is a suggestion for how a thread safe spinner could be implemented with a shared logger. This also allows for parallel spinners and progress bars.

```

The work will most likely have to be split into a couple of steps.

1. Remove any use of message fatal.
2. Refactor table printing functions.
3. Replace message logging with a structured logger.
4. Replace spinner and progress bars."
"## Context

Zarf currently does not have explicit schema versions. Any schema changes are embedded into Zarf and can change with new versions. There are several examples of deprecated keys throughout Zarf's lifespan such as:

- `setVariable` deprecated in favor of `setVariables`
- `scripts` deprecated in favor of `actions`
- `group` deprecated in favor of `flavor`, however these work functionally different and cannot be automatically migrated
- `cosignKeyPath` deprecated in favor of specifying the key path at create time

Zarf has not disabled any deprecated keys thus far. On create the user is always warned when using a deprecated field, however the field still exists in the schema and functions properly. Some of the deprecated keys can be migrated automatically as the old item is a subset or directly related to it's replacement. For example, setVariable is automatically migrated to a single item list of setVariables. This migration occurs on the zarf.yaml fed into the package during package create, however the original field is not deleted from the packaged zarf.yaml because the Zarf binary used in the airgap or delivery environment is not assumed to have the new schema fields that the deprecated key was migrated to.

The release of v1 will provide an opportunity to delete deprecated features that Zarf has warned will be dropped in v1.

Creating a v1 schema will allow Zarf to establish a contract with it's user base that features will be supported long term. When a feature is deprecated in the v1 schema, it will remain usable in the schema for the lifetime of v1.","## Decision

For Zarf v1, we will introduce an explicit schema versioning system to formalize the contract between the tool and its users. The v1 schema will remove support for deprecated fields that have been previously warned about as candidates for removal, ensuring a cleaner and more maintainable schema. Deprecated keys that can be automatically migrated (e.g., `setVariable` to `setVariables`) will no longer be supported in v1 schemas, and users must transition fully to the new keys.

To maintain backward compatibility during the transition:

- The packaging process will enforce migration of deprecated keys to their replacements before packaging, but the packaged manifests will only contain v1-compliant fields.
- Users will be notified during create and package operations about required schema updates or rejected deprecated keys.
- Deprecated keys that cannot be automatically migrated (e.g., `group` to `flavor`) will require manual user intervention to update configurations before upgrading to v1.

This approach will provide a stable, versioned schema contract starting at v1, allowing Zarf to manage future schema evolutions with clear versioning and deprecation policies while removing legacy complexity.","## Decision

Zarf will begin having proper schema versions. A top level key, `apiVersion`, will be introduced to allow users to specify the schema. At the release of v1 the only valid user input for `apiVersion` will be v1. Zarf will not allow users to build using the v0 schema. `zarf package create` will fail if the user has deprecated keys or if `apiVersion` is missing and the user will be instructed to run the new `zarf dev migrate-schema` command. `zarf dev migrate-schema` will automatically migrate deprecated fields in the users `zarf.yaml` where possible. It will also add the apiVersion key and set it to v1.

The existing go types which comprise the Zarf schema will be moved to types/alpha and will never change. An updated copy of these types without the deprecated fields will be created in a package types/v1 and any future schema changes will affect these objects. Internally, Zarf will introduce translation functions which will take the alpha schema and return the v1 schema. From that point on, all function signatures that have a struct that is included in the Zarf schema will change from `types.structName` to `v1.structName`.

All deprecated features will cause an error on create. Deprecated features with a direct migration path will still be deployed if the package was created with schema v1, as migrations will add the non deprecated fields. If a feature does not have a direct automatic migration path (cosignKeyPath & groups) the package will fail on deploy. This will happen until the alpha schema is entirely removed from Zarf, which will happen one year after v1 is released.

At create time Zarf will package both a `zarf.yaml` and a `zarfv1.yaml`. If a `zarfv1.yaml` exists Zarf will use that. If a `zarfv1.yaml` does not exist, then Zarf will know that the package was created prior to v1 and use the regular `zarf.yaml`. If the package is deployed with v0 it will read the `zarf.yaml` as normal even if the package has a `zarfv1.yaml`. This will make it simpler to drop deprecated items with migration paths from the v1 schema while remaining backwards compatible as those deprecated items will exist in the `zarf.yaml`

When Zarf introduces new keys that they are not ready to promise long term support for they will mark them as experimental in the schema. A key is assumed to be stable if it's not experimental or deprecated.

There are several other keys Zarf will deprecate which will have automated migrations to new fields
- `.metadata.aggregateChecksum` -> `.build.aggregateChecksum`
- `.components[x].required` -> `.components[x].optional`. Optional will default to false. This is a change in behavior as currently `required` defaults to true. However, automatic migration will work since we can set optional to true on any components which do not already have required.
- Metadata fields `image`, `source`, `documentation`, `url`, `authors`, `vendors` -> will become a map of `annotations`
- `noWait` -> `wait` which will default to true. This change will happen on both `.components.[x].manifests` and `components.[x].charts`
- `yolo` -> `airgap` which will default to true
- `.components.[x].actions.[default/onAny].maxRetries` -> `.components.[x].actions.[default/onAny].retries`
- `.components.[x].actions.[default/onAny].maxTotalSeconds` -> `.components.[x].actions.[default/onAny].timeout`, which must be in a [Go recognized duration string format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
- charts will change to avoid [current confusion with keys](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/2245). Exactly one of the following fields will exist for each `components.[x].charts`.
```yaml
  helm:
    url: https://stefanprodan.github.io/podinfo
    RepoName: podinfo # replaces repoName since it's only applicable for helm repos

  git:
    url: https://stefanprodan.github.io/podinfo
    path: charts/podinfo

  oci:
    url: oci://ghcr.io/stefanprodan/charts/podinfo

  local:
   path: chart
```
- A new field called `.components.[x].healthChecks` will be introduced and will utilize [kstatus](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cli-utils/blob/master/pkg/kstatus/README.md) to wait for resources to be ready after deployment. Read [#2718](https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/issues/2718) for more detail.
- a new field `.components.[x].wait` will be introduced. It will default to true, and automatically run `healthchecks` for every object in the cluster.
- `.components.[x].extensions` will be removed in favor of `zarf dev generate bigbang`. See #2875"
