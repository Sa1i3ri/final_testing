"## Context

* Currently, the images/thumbnails inside the Storefront are not making use of any lazy loading mechanism. 
* Without a third-party extension which includes something like ""lazysizes"" it is not possible to get lazy loading images.
* Native lazy loading of images is available in current browsers, see: https://caniuse.com/?search=loading","## Decision 
We will adopt native browser support for lazy loading of images using the `loading=""lazy""` attribute on `<img>` elements within the Storefront. This approach provides a lightweight, dependency-free solution aligned with modern browser capabilities. It avoids the need to include external libraries such as ""lazysizes,"" reducing complexity and potential conflicts.

For browsers that do not support native lazy loading, we will monitor usage and reevaluate the need for polyfills or third-party solutions in the future. In the meantime, images will load normally in those cases to preserve user experience.

Implementation steps:
1. Update the Storefront image components to include `loading=""lazy""` by default on thumbnail and relevant images.
2. Document this change to inform developers of the native lazy loading support.
3. Periodically review browser support levels and user metrics to assess if further enhancements are needed.","## Decision

* We want to make use of native lazy loading for images in the Storefront without adding additional JavaScript logic."

When using the `OneToOneAssociationField` & `ManyToOneAssociationField` associations it is possible to specify the parameter `autoload` as `true`. This causes the association to be loaded with every query, regardless of whether the data is used or not.

This is a performance issue due to unnecessary data transfer, it slows down SQL queries with extra joins, slows the application down with hydrating and data processing and finally, API payloads are larger than they need to be.","## Decision
We will discourage the use of the `autoload` parameter set to `true` on `OneToOneAssociationField` and `ManyToOneAssociationField` associations due to its negative performance impact. Instead, associations should be loaded explicitly and only when necessary to minimize unnecessary data transfer and processing overhead.

To support this, we will:
1. Make the default value of the `autoload` parameter `false` for these association fields.
2. Provide clear documentation and guidelines advising developers to load associations explicitly via selective queries or lazy-loading mechanisms.
3. Explore tooling or query-building support that facilitates explicit loading of associations to avoid inadvertent performance degradation.
4. Monitor application performance and query patterns to identify and refactor cases where `autoload` usage leads to inefficient data fetching.

This approach ensures better overall performance by reducing unnecessary joins and data hydration, leading to smaller API payloads and faster application response times.","## Decision

We will deprecate the usage of autoload === true in the core codebase in version 6.5. All usages in entity definitions should be removed by the time 6.6 is released.

We have introduced a new PHPStan rule which will check for any usages of autoload === true and fail if it finds any. The failures are currently ignored in the `phpstan.neon.dist` file until they can be fixed by the respective teams."

Currently, our ADRs are grouped into folders according to different areas. We have added this structure to help people find their way around when they are looking for specific ADRs.

However, there are different approaches when searching for ADRs:
1) I am looking for an ADR and I know the headline.
2) I would like to read the latest ADRs
3) I would like to see ADRs for a specific area.
4) ...

The structuring by areas is good for case 3, but not for the other two. In the first case, the user can easily use the search via the directory to use the appropriate ADR, but will also get duplicate matches. Depending on the keyword the result can be quite long.

In the second case, I would like to read the latest ADRs, the user would have to go to git history, which is only possible via shell or IDE.","## Decision 
To improve discoverability and accessibility of ADRs, we will implement an index or catalog file that aggregates metadata of all ADRs across areas. This index will include titles, dates, status, and area tags for each ADR, allowing users to:
- Search by headline or keywords with reduced duplication.
- Browse the latest ADRs by sorted date.
- Filter ADRs by specific areas if desired.
This index will be updated automatically as ADRs are added or modified, possibly through a CI/CD pipeline or a local script.
Additionally, we will consider adding metadata headers inside each ADR file (e.g., YAML front matter) to enable easier parsing and extraction of information.
Finally, we will document best practices for ADR naming conventions and keywords to improve search accuracy.","## Decision

We will remove the area structure on directory level and introduce front matter in our ADRs as we already do in our changelog files. This makes it possible to extract metadata from content. Additionally, it can be used as groundwork, if we want to release our ADRs in different front-ends (handbook, dev-docs) and use the front-end's search functionalities.
With front matter and the flat file structure, you can solve all three problems described in this ADR. An example of this specific ADR would be:

```markdown
---
title: Unstructured ADRs
date: 2023-02-23
area: Product Operation #I added prod-ops because this is a workflow topic
tags: [ADR, file structure, workflow]
---
```

We also hope that this will make it easier for people to submit ADRs without being confused about which folder to put the file in."
"## Context
Our current plugin extension system for the administration is based on our Component Factory. This factory generates native Vue components at runtime based on a base Shopware component which can be extended or overwritten by plugins. This approach offers flexibility to plugin developers to modify every component. For the template part, we use Twig.JS and compile the Vue template in the client at runtime.

However, this approach has its drawbacks. We cannot use the full power of Vue and its ecosystem because everything related to Vue is wrapped with our factories and generated at runtime. We cannot use Vue tools without custom modifications, like linting template files, providing good static analysis, and more. The other downside is that upgrading Vue is challenging, and the performance suffers because we cannot precompile components.

To address these issues, we aimed to test a new idea with Vue 3, which includes all the features of the existing plugin approach, but developed using only native Vue tools. This would offer several benefits, like using the full power of Vue, better performance, better static analysis, and more.

Our main idea for the template part was to use native Vue components named sw-block that can replace the Twig.JS template part. Plugin developers can extend or overwrite the sw-block component as needed.

```html
<sw-block name=""sw-hello-world"">
<div>Hello World</div>
</sw-block>
```

For the script and logic part, we aimed to use the Composition API. Before returning all the component data and methods, we would provide a hook point for plugins so they could modify or inject everything they want.

```js
// The original component
<script setup lang=""ts"">
// Hook for providing extensibility
useExtensibility();
</script>

// The plugin component
<script lang=""ts"">
    import SwOrignal from './sw-original.vue';
    // use our extensibility helpers
    import { useComponentExtender, getPropsFromComponent } from 'sw-vue-extensbiles';
    
    const myCustomData = ref('test');
    
    export default {
        name: 'sw-extended-component',
        props: {
            ...getPropsFromComponent(SwOrignal)
        },
        setup(props, context) {
            return {
                ...useComponentExtender(SwOrignal, props, context),
                myCustomData
            }   
        }
}
</script>
```

However, during the evaluation and testing, we realized that this approach was not feasible due to several reasons. The most critical challenges were that it was hard to merge data because the Vue compiler optimizes many parts of the component, and it was not easy to pass all the data of the component to the block system to give plugin developers full access to the original component's data.

To solve these problems, we would need to use internal Vue logic, which is not update-safe and could break with every Vue update.","## Decision
We will abandon the approach of fully leveraging native Vue 3 components and the Composition API with extensibility hooks as initially envisioned because the challenges of merging component data and providing full plugin access to original component data proved infeasible and fragile.

Instead, we will continue to rely on our existing Component Factory approach, which generates native Vue components at runtime based on Shopware base components. Although this limits some Vue ecosystem features and complicates upgrades, it provides a stable and flexible plugin extension system without relying on Vue internal logic.

We will explore incremental improvements focusing on:
- Gradually enhancing the Component Factory to better support tooling integration (linting, static analysis).
- Investigating ways to precompile or optimize runtime-generated components.
- Monitoring Vue updates closely to identify safer integration points for future native Vue extensibility mechanisms.

This pragmatic path ensures stability and existing plugin compatibility while acknowledging the current Vue 3 native extensibility approach is not sufficiently robust or maintainable.","## Decision
After considering the challenges we faced with the proposed solution, we concluded that we couldn't find solutions without using internal Vue logic. Given this situation, we did not see any significant benefits to adopting a native Vue solution over our current plugin system, which, despite its challenges, has proven to work well for our use case.

Therefore, we decided to stick with our current plugin system for the administration until new possibilities arise in Vue that solve our problems."

The current workflow for writing technical changelog is not very suited for a trunk based development and branching process. There are some major issues with the current workflow of using one file with a fixed version number:

*  Unnecessary merge conflicts in the changelog file
*  Uncertainty about the correct release version of the change
*  Differences between the issue state in Jira and the code state

To tackle these issues the technique for writing technical changelog and upgrade information, should be changed to a single solution, which is easy to understand and maintain by developers.","## Decision 
We will adopt a ""fragment-based"" changelog workflow to better support trunk-based development and reduce merge conflicts.
- Developers will create individual changelog fragments in separate files at the time they make changes, rather than updating a single changelog file.
- Each fragment will clearly state the description of the change, associated issue or ticket number, and intended release version if known.
- During the release process, a tool will aggregate all accepted changelog fragments into a consolidated changelog document for the release version.
- This approach will improve clarity about which changes belong to which release and minimize merge conflicts by avoiding multiple concurrent edits to the same changelog file.
- It will also encourage developers to write upgrade notes and change summaries at the point of change, keeping the information fresh and reducing uncertainty about the status of changes.
- Synchronization with Jira issue states will be maintained through referencing issue IDs in fragments and automated validation during release.","## Decision
The changelog and upgrade files for a release should be autogenerated in the build process of the release. Developers should write technical changelog and upgrade information in separate markdown files."

The actions in Flow Builder are listening for Business Events. We want to implement the flow DelayAction in Flow Builder,
that means the actions can be delayed, and will be executed after  a set amount of time.
But we have some problems after the action was delayed:
* Events may contain old data, that data may be updated during the delay, and currently we don't have any way to restore
    the data.
* After a delay the rules have to be re-evaluated, but the data in the rules could be outdated or changed, so the rules
    have to be reloaded as well. Or the rules do not exist anymore.","## Decision  
To implement the DelayAction in Flow Builder while addressing data staleness and rule validity, we will adopt the following approach:  

1. **Snapshotting Event Context:**  
   When a DelayAction is triggered, we will capture a snapshot of the relevant business event data at that point in time. This snapshot will be stored alongside the delayed action to preserve the exact context.  

2. **Event Data Refresh Upon Execution:**  
   Before executing the delayed action after the specified delay, the system will attempt to refresh the event data from the authoritative source to ensure it reflects the latest state. If the data has changed, the updated event data will be used for action execution.  

3. **Rule Re-evaluation and Reloading:**  
   Upon delayed execution, the rules related to the action will be reloaded and re-evaluated against the current data. This ensures that rules that no longer apply or have been modified are respected.  

4. **Handling Missing or Invalid Rules:**  
   If, after delay, the rule definitions referenced by the action no longer exist or are invalid, the action will be aborted gracefully with appropriate logging and notifications to stakeholders.  

5. **Atomic Execution Context:**  
   The delayed action execution will occur within a transactional boundary to maintain consistency between data refresh, rule evaluation, and action processing.  

This approach balances the need to delay actions with ensuring that data and rules remain consistent and up-to-date at execution time, avoiding the pitfalls of executing with stale or invalid context.","## Decision

We would need to detach the Event System and the Flow System from each other, thus removing the dependency on the runtime objects within an event.
Meaning the Actions must not have access to the original Events.

We would create a class `StorableFlow`, that can store the data in the original event as scalar values, and restore the original data based on this stored data.
```php
class StorableFlow
{
    // contains the scalar values based on the original events
    // $store can be serialized and used to restore the object data
    protected array $store = [];
    
    // contains the restored object data like the data we defined in the `availableData` in original events 
    // $data can not be serialized, but can be restored from $store
    protected array $data = [];
      
    public function __construct(array $store = [], array $data = [])
    {
        $this->store = $store;
        $this->data = $data;
    }
    
    // This method will be called in each `Storer` to store the representation of data
    public function setStore(string $key, $value) {
        $this->store[$key] = $value;
    }
    
    public function getStore(string $key) {
        return $this->store[$key];
    }
    
    // After we restored the data in `Storer`, we can set the data, we'll use `$this->data` instead getter data on original event
    public function setData(string $key, $value) {
        $this->data[$key] = $value;
    }
    
    public function getData(string $key) {
        return $this->data[$key];
    }
}
```

The `StorableFlow` class will be use on Flow Builder:

Before:

```php
class FlowDispatcher 
{
    public function dispatch(Event $event) {
        ...
        // Currently, dispatch on Flow Builder use the original event to execute the Flow 
        $this->callFlowExecutor($event);
        ...
    }
}
```

After:

```php
class FlowDispatcher 
{
    public function dispatch(Event $event) {
        ...
        // The `FlowFactory` will create/restore the `StorableFlow` from original event
        $flow = $this->flowFactory->create($event);
        // use the `StorableFlow` to execute the flow builder actions instead of the original events
        $this->execute($flow);
        ...
    }
}
```

* Flow Builder actions may no longer access the original event.
* Each Aware Interface gets its own `Storer` class to restore the data of Aware, so we have many `Storer` like `OrderStorer`, `MailStorer`, `CustomerStorer` ...
* The main task of a `Storer` is to restore the data from a scalar storage.
* The `Storer` provides a store function, in order to store itself the data, in order restore the object
* The `Storer` provides a restore function to restore the object using the store data.

```php
interface FlowStorer {}
```
Example for `OrderStorer`:

```php
class OrderStorer implements FlowStorer
{
    // This function to check the original event is the instanceof Aware interface, and store the representation.
    public function store(FlowEventAware $event, array $storedData): array 
    {
        if ($event instanceof OrderAware) {
            $storedData['orderId'] = $event->getOrderId();
        }
        
        return $storedData;
    }
    
    // This function is restore the data based on representation in `storedData`
    public function restore(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {
        if ($flow->hasStore('orderId')) {
            // allows to provide a closure for lazy data loading
            // this opens the opportunity to have lazy loading for big data
            // When we load the entity, we need to add the necessary associations for each entity
            $flow->lazy('order', [$this, 'load']);    
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

About the additional data defined in `availableData` in original events, that aren't defined in any Aware Interfaces and we can't restore that data in the `Storer`.
To cover the additional data from original events, we will have another `store` `AdditionalStorer` to store those data.
```php
class AdditionalStorer extends FlowStorer
{
    public function store(FlowEventAware $event, array $storedData)
    {
        ...
        // based on the `getAvailableData` in the original event to get the type of additional data
        $additionalDataTypes = $event::getAvailableData()->toArray();
        
        foreach ($additionalDataTypes as $key => $eventData) {
            // Check if the type of data is Entity or EntityCollection
            // in the $storedData, we only store the presentation like ['id' => id, 'entity' => entity], we'll restore the data in `AdditionalStorer::restore`
            if ($eventData['type'] === 'Entity' || 'EntityCollection') {
                $storedData[$key] = [
                    'id' => $event->getId(),
                    'entity' => Entity                 
                ];
            }
            
            // Check if the type of data is ScalarValueType
            if ($eventData['type'] === ScalarValueType) {
                $storedData[$key] = value
            }
            
            // start to implement /Serializable for ObjectType
            if ($eventData['type'] === ObjectType) {
                $storedData[$key] = value->serialize()
            }
            
            ...
        }
        
        ... 
        
        return $storedData;
    }
      
    // this function  make sure we can restore the additional data from original data are not covered in `Storer`
    // The additional data can be other entity, because the entities we defined in Aware interface like `order`, `customer` ... covered be `Storer`
    public function restore(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {
        if (type === entity) {
            // About the associations for entity data, mostly the additional entity data is the base entity, we don't need to add associations for this
            $flow->setData($key, $this->load());
        } else {
            $flow->setData($key, $flow->getStore($key));
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

About the associations for entity data, mostly the additional entity data is the base entity, we don't need to add associations for this.
About the `ObjectType` data, we enforce all values used in ObjectType implement /Serializable, and serialize the object before store to `$storedData`.

* Flow Builder actions only work with the `StorableFlow` instead of the `FlowEvent`. The `StorableFlow` will restore the data from original events via `Storer`,
  and the Actions can get the data via `getData($key)` from `StorableFlow` instead of `getAvailableData` from original events.

Before, in the flow actions still dependency Aware interfaces:

```php
    public function handle(StorableFlow $event) {
        ...
        $baseEvent = $event->getEvent();
    
        if ($baseEvent instanceof CustomerAware) {
            $customerId= $baseEvent->getCustomerId();
        }
        ...
    }
```
After in the flow actions:
```php
    public function handle(StorableFlow $event) {
        ...
        if ($event->hasStore('customerId') {
            $customerId= $event->getStore('customerId');
        }
        ...
    }
```

* `getAvailableData` must NOT be responsible for the access of the data.
* To create new or restore the `StorableFlow` by on the existing stored data, we need to provider the `FlowFactory`.
```php
class FlowFactory
{    
    ...
    public function create(FlowEventAware $event)
    {
        $storedData = [];
        foreach ($this->storer as $storer) {
            // Storer are responsible to move the corresponding 
            // data from the original event 
            $storer->store($event, $storedData);
        }
        
        return $this->restore($storedData);
    }
  
    public function restore(array $stored = [], array $data = [])
    {
        $flow = new StorableFlow($stored, $data);
      
        foreach ($this->storer as $storer) {
            $storer->restore($flow);
        }
  
        return $flow;
    }
    ...
}
```
But when executing a delayed actions, we won't have a `StorableFlow`, we just have the `$stored` from the previously stored `StorableFlow`,
and based on the `$stored`, we can restore a new `StorableFlow`.

Example in Delay Actions:

```php
// In handler delay actions -> put the actions to `queue`
$stored = json_encode($flow->stored());

$connection->executeStatement('INSERT INTO `swag_delay_action` (store) VALUES (:stored)...', ['stored' => $stored]);
```

```php
// In handler execute delay actions
$stored = 'SELECT store FROM `swag_delay_action` .... ';

$flow = $this->flowFactory->restore(json_decode($stored));
```"

We need a different extension mechanism besides the well known plugins, that works in cloud and on-prem environments in the same way.
That's why we envisioned the app system, currently publicly available as a [plugin](https://github.com/shopware/app-system).
We were able to quickly develop the app system, gather feedback and iterate over ideas without being bound to the strict release workflow of the shopware platform.
That was the reason why we started working on the app system as a plugin in the first place.

Now as the app system matured, it is time to integrate the app system back into the platform.
This has the following benefits:
* It sends the signal to partners and potential app manufacturers that the app system is stable
* Partners / app manufacturers can rely on the shopware 6 release cycle and the according upgrade process
* Users don't need to install an extra plugin in order to use apps","## Decision 
We will integrate the app system, currently available as a standalone plugin, directly into the Shopware 6 platform as a core component.
This integration will be planned and executed in a way that:
- Ensures the app system benefits from the platform's standard release and upgrade cycles, increasing stability and reliability for partners and users.
- Removes the necessity for users to install an additional plugin to use the app system, improving user experience.
- Continues to support both cloud and on-premises environments with a unified extension mechanism.
- Maintains backward compatibility and provides a clear migration path for existing users of the standalone app system plugin.
- Signals maturity and commitment to the app system, encouraging adoption by partners and app manufacturers.
By making the app system a built-in part of the Shopware platform, we aim to provide a more seamless, stable, and reliable extension mechanism that aligns with the platform's overall development and release practices.","## Decision

We will migrate the existing app system from the [plugin](https://github.com/shopware/app-system) into the platform. The app system will be part of the core bundle, analogous to the plugin system.
It will be moved to the `Shopware\Core\Framework\App` namespace."

At the moment we have a bunch of different `FlowStorer` implementations. Most of them are used to store scalar values without any restore logic. Each of the Storer class has an own interface which is used to identify if the data of the event should be stored. This leads to much boilerplate code when adding new storer implementations or when plugins want to bypass some for events.","## Decision
We will unify and simplify the `FlowStorer` implementations by defining a single, generic interface for storing scalar values. This interface will decouple the storage mechanism from the event data filtering logic.
Specifically:
1. Introduce a common base interface or protocol for all `FlowStorer` implementations that focuses solely on storing and restoring scalar values.
2. Move the event filtering logic out of the individual storers and into a higher-level component, such as a centralized filter manager or event dispatcher, that decides whether or not to invoke a particular storer based on event metadata or attributes.
3. Provide plugins and extensions with a straightforward way to hook into or override the filtering mechanism without needing to create new storer classes or interfaces.
4. Document this new design pattern for flow storage clearly to facilitate extension and avoid duplicate boilerplate.
This approach will reduce boilerplate code, improve maintainability, and make the system more flexible and extensible for plugin developers.","## Decision

We introduce a generic `ScalarValuesAware` interface which can be used to store simple values which should be simply stored and restored one to one:

```php
interface ScalarValuesAware
{
    public const STORE_VALUES = 'scalar_values';
    
    /** @return array<string, scalar|null|array> */
    public function getValues(): array;
}
```

This event can be used in different events which needs a simple storage logic:

```php
class SomeFlowAwareEvent extends Event implements ScalarStoreAware, FlowEventAware
{
    public function __construct(private readonly string $url) { }

    public function getValues(): array
    {
        return ['url' => $this->url];
    }
}
```

To store and restore this data, we provide a simple `FlowStorer` implementation:

```php

class ScalarValuesStorer extends FlowStorer
{
    public function store(FlowEventAware $event, array $stored): array
    {
        if (!$event instanceof ScalarValuesAware) return $stored

        $stored[ScalarValuesAware::STORE_VALUES] = $event->getValues();

        return $stored;
    }

    public function restore(StorableFlow $storable): void
    {
        $values = $storable->getStore(ScalarValuesAware::STORE_VALUES);
        foreach ($values as $key => $value) {
            $storable->setData($key, $value);
        }
    }
}

The current sw-text-editor in the administration has numerous low-level bugs in basic WYSIWYG features. It is built in a
way that is difficult to maintain and understand. Therefore, we require a new text editor that is easy to maintain, has
a good feature set, is flexible to extend and more stable.","## Decision
We will replace the existing sw-text-editor with a new text editor that prioritizes maintainability, stability, and flexibility. The new editor will be selected based on the following criteria:
- Robust and stable core functionality with minimal low-level bugs in WYSIWYG features.
- Modular and extensible design to allow future enhancements and customizations with ease.
- Clear, well-documented codebase that is easier for developers to understand and maintain.
- Support for all essential text editing features required by the administration interface.
- Compatibility with the existing architecture and technology stack.
The implementation process will include:
1. Research and evaluate potential text editor libraries or frameworks that meet these criteria.
2. Prototype integration with the administrative interface to assess usability and stability.
3. Gather feedback from users and developers on the prototype.
4. Gradually replace the old editor with the new one, ensuring feature parity and smooth transition.
5. Document the new editor’s architecture and extension points for developers.
By adopting this approach, we aim to have a reliable, maintainable, and user-friendly text editor that improves administrative workflows.","## Decision
Building a new text editor from scratch is not a viable option. Therefore, we have evaluated various existing text

We have decided to skip CKEditor 5 and TinyMCE because they require a license for our use case and are not 100% open
source. Prosemirror was also ruled out because it provides only a low-level API and requires much more implementation 
time than the other editors. Additionally, Lexical is not a valid option for us since it is specialized for React 
environments and has no official support for VueJS.

The remaining two editors are TipTap V2 and QuillJS. Both have similar feature sets and APIs, but we have found some 
major differences between them. The first difference is that TipTap is a headless editor, which means that it only
provides the editor logic and requires a UI implementation. QuillJS, on the other hand, is a fully featured editor that
provides a UI out of the box. In our case, it is better to use a headless editor like TipTap because we can implement 
the UI to fit our needs, especially for several edge cases that are hard to implement in QuillJS.

The second major difference is in extensibility. TipTap's API is more flexible, allowing us to implement our own
features using the existing TipTap and ProseMirror plugins or build our own plugins. In most cases, the powerful main
TipTap API can already solve most of our use cases. QuillJS, on the other hand, is not as flexible as TipTap, and its
extension system is more complicated to use.

The third big difference is in stability. We found that TipTap is more stable than QuillJS, probably because TipTap is 
built on top of ProseMirror, which is a very stable and well-tested editor. Although QuillJS is also generally stable,
other developers have reported some issues with it in the past.

Our main decision driver was the extensibility of the editor. We want a text editor that is easy to extend and allows us
to implement our own features. TipTap provides a powerful extension system that is easy to use, and we can implement our
design without overwriting an existing design of other editors. Therefore, we have decided to use TipTap as the base of
our new text editor."

The current implementation of the salutation in Shopware 6 needs to handle cases where the salutation is not specified by the customer or administrator. To address this requirement and promote inclusivity, we have updated the default salutation to ""not_specified"" for unspecified salutations in our Shopware 6 platform.","## Decision
We will update the default salutation value in Shopware 6 to ""not_specified"" to handle cases where the customer or administrator has not provided a salutation. This change promotes inclusivity by avoiding assumptions or gender-specific defaults. All components relying on salutations will be updated to recognize and correctly process the ""not_specified"" value. Documentation and user interfaces will also reflect this new default to ensure clarity for users and administrators.","## Decision
We have modified the existing salutation handling in Shopware 6 to update the default value to ""not_specified"" when the salutation is null. This decision was made based on the following considerations:

* Inclusivity: By offering a default salutation of ""not_specified"" for null values, we promote inclusivity and ensure that all customers are appropriately addressed, even when salutation data is missing.
* Customer Experience: Providing a default salutation ensures consistency in customer communications and prevents any confusion or misinterpretation when a salutation is not explicitly specified.
* Non-Deletable Default Salutation: It has been decided that the ""not_specified"" salutation, being the default value for unspecified salutations, should not be deletable by the shop owner. This ensures that there is always a fallback option available, guaranteeing a consistent experience for customers."

The storefront CSS, compiled by `scssphp/scssphp`, is currently automatically prefixed with vendor prefixes using `padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer`.
However, the generated prefixes no longer add much value since the browser support has been updated with the Bootstrap v5 update.
Most of the prefixes are unnecessary for the supported browsers in .browserslist.
Unfortunately, the `theme:compile` process experiences a significant decrease in performance due to the auto-prefixer, which is particularly problematic in our SaaS solution.
Moreover, the `padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer` package does not work dynamically and fails to consider `.browserslist` while applying the appropriate vendor-prefixes.
This package hard-codes the CSS properties that require prefixing, making it an unsustainable long-term solution.
To demonstrate this, a table containing all automatic prefixes generated by `padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer` is provided below.","## Decision  
We will remove the use of `padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer` from the `theme:compile` process due to its performance impact and unsuitability for our current browser support requirements.
Instead, we will rely on modern browser support and the updated Bootstrap v5 defaults to handle necessary vendor prefixing.
This means:
- The CSS compilation step will no longer run a separate autoprefixing tool.
- Our `.browserslist` configuration will be maintained carefully to reflect the target browser set we support.
- If future needs arise for vendor prefixing, we will consider adopting a more dynamic, standards-compliant autoprefixer tool that respects `.browserslist` or move to a build process that integrates with Node-based tools such as `postcss` with `autoprefixer`.
This change will improve the performance of our `theme:compile` process and simplify maintenance by removing reliance on an unmaintained and rigid package.","## Decision

* Due to the above points we have decided to disable the CSS auto-prefixing by default.
* In case it is still needed, to support older browsers or some special CSS property from the table above, it can still be activated via the config key `storefront.theme.auto_prefix_css` in `Storefront/Resources/config/packages/storefront.yaml`. However, we recommend to do a manual prefix inside the SCSS instead.
* We will deprecate the auto-prefixing for v6.6.0 and only use SCSS compiling
* We do not consider the deactivation of the auto-prefixing as a hard breaking change because:
    * Most prefixes are not needed due to current browser support.
    * Some prefixes are for CSS properties which are no longer implemented and developed by browsers.
    * Prefixes which are still valid are primarily cosmetic/appearance properties which are very unlikely to affect the Storefronts functionality."

A pre-release package version is a version followed by a hyphen and an alphanumeric string.

Imagine the following scenario:
* An imaginary package is marked as insecure with version 1.8.7
* The issue is fixed with 2.0.0
* We use version `1.9.0-alpha1`
* Any pre-release package version like `1.9.0-alpha1` is interpreted as `<0.0.0` by npm

Why is this problematic?

The insecurity introduced with version `1.8.7` would never get reported to us by npm, unless we switch to a none pre-release version.","## Decision  
We will avoid using npm pre-release version tags (versions containing hyphens and alphanumeric suffixes) for production or security-sensitive packages in Arachne.
Instead, during pre-release or alpha/beta development, we will use alternative versioning schemes or metadata that are understood by npm as greater than prior stable versions.
For example, we will consider using semantic versioning with higher patch or minor version numbers without pre-release tags (e.g., `1.9.0` or `1.9.0+alpha.1`), or publish under distinct npm tags rather than relying on pre-release versions.
This approach ensures that vulnerability scanning tools and npm itself interpret version numbers correctly with respect to remediation and security advisories.
In the case that pre-release versions must be used, we will clearly document the risks and have a process in place to monitor vulnerabilities and quickly adopt safe stable versions to avoid silent exposure to known security issues.","## Decision
Using pre-release package versions is prohibited.
This will be checked via a npm `preinstall` script."

The existing SQL snippet to delete the outdated cart entries doesn't use any database index to narrow down entries that can be deleted. 
On high traffic shops this leads to SQL query times larger than 30 seconds to find and remove these database entries.

Running 
```
EXPLAIN DELETE FROM cart
WHERE (updated_at IS NULL AND created_at <= '2023-02-01')
   OR (updated_at IS NOT NULL AND updated_at <= '2023-02-01') LIMIT 1000;

To improve deletion performance for outdated cart entries, we will create a composite index on the columns used in the deletion query predicates: `updated_at` and `created_at`. This index will enable the database query planner to efficiently locate candidate rows for deletion, significantly reducing query time from over 30 seconds to a reasonable duration even under high traffic.

The recommended index definition is:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_cart_updated_created ON cart (updated_at, created_at);
```

Additionally, the deletion query will be rewritten to better leverage the index structure by avoiding complex OR conditions potentially by batching deletions into multiple simpler queries if necessary.

This approach ensures that deleting outdated cart entries is performant, scale-friendly, and does not impact application responsiveness under heavy load.","## Decision

Reorder the query parameters so that the relevant cart entries can be narrowed down by an indexed field.

Currently, it is hard to publish features in an early state to gather feedback regarding those features. If they are useful, what needs to be improved etc.
One major reason is that everything we publish (that is not marked as internal) is part of our backwards compatibility promise, thus changing foundational parts of features is quite hard after first release.
That leads to features being developed over quite some time without getting actual feedback from users or being able to release them, as they need to be implemented to a pretty final state in order to confidently release them in a stable manner, where we will keep backwards compatibility.

This at the same time also means that the current approach is not beneficial to our ecosystem, whom the whole backwards compatibility promise should benefit, because the features are built behind closed curtains they can't chime in with ideas and use cases regarding extendability, etc.

Examples of features that could benefit from an earlier experimental release:
* B2B:
  * We could release the multi account B2B feature with a ""simple"" employee management system first, and then add the more complex budget management or access control on top of that later.
* Advanced Search:
  * We could release a first version of the new advanced search feature, without all configuration options and customizability that we might envision.

In both cases, releasing the first increments of the features without an ""experimental""-flag would mean that we would have to keep backwards compatibility for the whole feature, even if we later decide to change the implementation of the feature, thus making the development of the feature harder.
Also in getting feedback from the customers what additional functionalities are needed after we released the first foundational increment of the feature, we can base our further prioritization on real customer feedback.
Thus, we can ship business value sooner to our customers and lower the risk of building the wrong thing.","## Decision 
We will introduce an ""experimental feature"" flag in our release and versioning process to allow partial, early releases of features that are not yet considered stable or fully complete.
Features marked as experimental will:
- Be excluded from the backwards compatibility guarantees that apply to stable features.
- Be clearly labeled as experimental in documentation and user interfaces.
- Allow customers to opt-in to preview and provide feedback on early-stage functionality.
- Permit iterative development and significant changes without the constraints of maintaining backward compatibility.
- Facilitate incremental releases that deliver value early, while enabling prioritization based on actual user feedback.
This approach will require tooling and processes to manage and track experimental features, including the ability to promote experimental features to stable once they reach maturity and confidence levels sufficient for backward compatibility guarantees.
By doing so, we increase transparency, accelerate feedback loops, and reduce the risk and cost associated with long development cycles behind closed doors.","## Decision

To ship features earlier, we add the concept of ""experimental"" features, thus giving early access to meaningful increments of features that are still in active development.
That means in particular that there is no backwards compatibility promise for experimental features, thus we can change the implementation as is needed, without having to worry about breaking changes.
We mark the code for those features with a new `experimental` annotation, to make it clear on code level that the API is **not yet** stable.
For code where already expect that it should never become part of the public API we will use the `@internal` annotation directly, to make sure that even if the feature is stable we will continue to tread those parts of the code as internal and not keep backwards compatible.
Everything that is marked with `@experimental` is designed to be part of the public API, when the feature is stable.

At the same time, it offers a way for the ecosystem to give early feedback on the feature, as well as to test it in their own projects. Especially, extension developers can check how they might want to integrate and extend the feature being built, and thus suggest the needed extension points during the development process.
To make this possible that means that there also will be documentation (API docs, dev docs and user docs) for experimental features

All experimental features are developed with a specific target version, beginning with that version, the feature is considered stable, and the APIs will be kept backwards compatible.
This means that `experimental` annotation/attribute have to be removed, before the version can be released. Because it is hard to estimate exactly with which release a feature may be stable (as it also depends on the feedback we get) it makes sense to mark them as being stable with the next major version.
That does not mean that the feature won't be finished and stable earlier (we can remove the experimental status with any minor version), it only means that at the latest with that version it is considered stable, this prevents a situation where a lot of features stay in the experimental state for a long time."

The stock handling in Shopware 6 is currently not very flexible and does not support many common use cases. 

* It's not possible to easily replace the loading of stocks with a custom implementation, for example one that communicates with an ERP.
* It's not possible to easily modify how stock is increased/decreased throughout the order lifecycle.
* Available stock calculation is very slow on large catalogs.
* Stock is stored as two distinct values: stock and available stock. This is due to the fact that stock is not reduced until an order is set as completed. Therefore, the available stock is calculated as the stock minus all open orders. This is unnecessarily complex.","## Decision 
We will redesign the stock handling system in Shopware 6 to be more flexible, extensible, and efficient to meet the identified shortcomings.
Key architectural decisions include:
1. Abstract Stock Loading: Introduce a clear separation for stock loading logic via a defined interface so that the current implementation can be easily replaced or extended, for example, enabling integration with ERP systems.
2. Event-driven Stock Adjustment: Implement hooks or events in the order lifecycle to allow customization of how stock is increased or decreased at various stages, enabling fine-grained control.
3. Optimize Stock Calculation: Refactor the calculation of available stock to improve performance, possibly by caching or recalculating only on relevant events rather than querying all open orders on demand.
4. Unified Stock Representation: Simplify the stock model by consolidating stock and available stock into a single value that reflects real-time availability, avoiding the complexity of maintaining two separate fields.
5. Provide Backward Compatibility: Where possible, maintain compatibility or migration paths for existing data and extensions to minimize disruption.
This redesign will enhance the flexibility and performance of stock handling, making it easier to customize and scale for various business needs.","## Decision

We have only one field `stock` in the product definition which always has a real time calculated value.

The `stock` value should be correctly updated as an order and its line items transition through the various states. Eg, stock is decremented when an order is placed. If it is cancelled, the stock is increased, and so on.

We have a clear API for manipulating stock which can be extended and supports arbitrary data, which could, for example, support features such as multi warehouse inventory.

We have a way to disable the stock handling behavior of Shopware."

By default, every exception that is thrown in the PHP stack and not caught will be logged by the `symfony/monolog-bridge` on `error` level.
But there are some cases where the exception is caused by clients accessing the API wrong (missing fields etc.) and throwing an `ShopwareHttpException` with an HTTP-Status-Code of 40x is our way of handling such situations and returning a correct HTTP-Status-Code to the client.
So those cases are in fact no ""errors"" that need to be analyzed, but are expected given a malformed API request.
Logging those cases as ""errors"" produces a lot of noise, which makes it harder to actually find errors in the logs.

For our cloud product, we already used a configuration list that configures that some Exception classes should only be logged as notices.","## Decision
To reduce noise in the error logs caused by expected client-side exceptions, we will implement a configurable logging level override for specific exception classes in the PHP backend.
This configuration will allow us to specify a list of exception classes (e.g., `ShopwareHttpException` and others representing client input errors) that should be logged at a lower severity level, such as ""notice,"" instead of ""error.""
Concretely:
1. The logging system (`symfony/monolog-bridge`) will be extended or configured to check the thrown exception against this list during logging.
2. If the exception matches a configured class, the log entry will be recorded at the overridden severity (e.g., ""notice""), reflecting the expected nature of the exception.
3. All other exceptions will continue to be logged at the standard ""error"" level.
This approach aligns with existing practices used in our cloud product and helps keep logs clean and focused on genuine errors requiring investigation, while still recording expected malformed request issues for transparency and debugging purposes.","## Decision

We add a configuration to the platform that degrades the error level of specific exceptions to notices. This way, external hosters can also profit from our classification.
We use [symfony's `exceptions` configuration](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/framework.html#exceptions) for this.

This has the benefit that for specific projects this configuration could be adjusted, for example, for cases where you also control all clients that access the shop, you may want to log also every client error, just to help debugging the client.

Another solution could be to do the configuration of the log level directly in the exception class either by attributes or a separate method specifying the log level, but that would make overwriting it for a specific project harder, so we stick to the default symfony configuration."

Using UUIDs as primary keys eases the integration of several different data sources,
but it also brings some performance issues.

Currently, we're using UUIDv4, which is a random UUID the completely random prefix means
that the B-tree indexes of the database are not very efficient.

UUIDv7 time-based prefix is less spread than that of UUIDv4, this helps the database to keep the index more compact.
It allows the Index to allocate fewer new pages and to keep the index smaller.","## Decision
We will switch from using UUIDv4 to UUIDv7 as the default primary key format for our application data.
By using UUIDv7, which incorporates a time-based prefix, we can improve the performance of database indexes, particularly B-tree indexes.
This approach maintains the benefits of UUIDs—such as ease of integration across multiple data sources and uniqueness—while mitigating the downside of index fragmentation seen with the fully random UUIDv4.
The transition will be documented clearly, and all new data entries will use UUIDv7.
Attempts to convert or migrate existing UUIDv4 keys will be assessed on a case-by-case basis to avoid data inconsistencies or significant migration overhead.","## Decision

Considering there is little risk to using UUIDv7, as v4 and v7 share the same
length and are indistinguishable for shopware, we can switch to v7 without any risk
of breaking anything.

The effort is also very low as we only need to change the
implementation of the `Uuid` class. As using UUIDv7 will improve the speed of
bulk product inserts by about 8 %, we think the effort is worth the measurable and
theoretical gain."

Currently, apps can not extend the list of available events in the flow builder.","## Decision 
We will introduce an extension mechanism in the flow builder that allows applications to register and define new event types. This will be achieved by:
1. Providing a well-documented API or configuration point where new event definitions can be supplied.
2. Ensuring that these custom events integrate seamlessly with the existing flow builder infrastructure, including validation, serialization, and user interface representation.
3. Allowing modular contributions to extend the catalog of events without requiring modifications to the core flow builder codebase.
4. Maintaining backward compatibility so existing flows and events continue to function as before.
This approach aligns with Arachne’s goal of modularity and configurability, empowering developers to tailor the flow builder to their specific domain requirements while preserving transparency and maintainability.","## Decision

Right now only Shopware Backend is able to communicate with the App Server in a secure way.
This is because the App Server is able to verify the origin of the request by checking request signature, 
and this signature is generated by the Shopware 6 backend application with a shop to app server secret.

When an app wants to communicate directly with the App Server,
the App Server is not able to verify the origin of the request and has to trust the client.
This works fine for public available data, but not when you reliably need the logged-in customer and other information.","## Decision 
We will extend the existing request verification mechanism used by the Shopware Backend to include apps communicating directly with the App Server.
Specifically:
1. Each app that needs to communicate securely with the App Server will be issued a unique secret shared between the app and the App Server.
2. The app will sign its requests using this secret, generating a request signature in the same way the Shopware Backend does.
3. The App Server will verify incoming requests by validating the signature against the expected secret for the app, ensuring authenticity and integrity.
4. This approach will enable the App Server to securely verify the origin of requests from apps, allowing it to reliably identify the logged-in customer and other sensitive information.
5. Publicly available data will continue to be accessible without signature verification, preserving flexibility.
This decision maintains secure communication channels, prevents unauthorized access or spoofing, and aligns the app communication mechanism with the existing trusted Shopware Backend approach.","## Decision

We provide a new endpoint `/store-api/app-system/{appName}/generate-token` (`/app-system/{appName}/generate-token` in Storefront) which generates a JWT token for the given app.
This endpoint requires that the customer is logged-in and the app is installed and active. 

The JWT token contains claims like:
- `iat` - issued at
- `exp` - expiration time
- `shopId` - the shop id of the current shop
- `salesChannelId` - the sales channel id of the current sales channel
- `customerId` - the customer id of the logged-in customer
- `cartToken` - the cart token of the current cart

The additional claims are bound to app permissions when an app does not have permissions to read a customer,
it does not get the `customerId` claim.

The JWT token is signed with the shop to app server secret key which we use already for the signature.
So the App Server needs to be able to verify the JWT key and use the claims in a secure way.
The request body of the client is still untrusted and has to be properly validated by the app server.

The request cycle would look like this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Shopware Backend
    participant App Server
    Client->>Shopware Backend: GET /store-api/app-system/TestApp/generate-token
    Shopware Backend->>Client: Responds with Signed JWT Token
    Client->>App Server: Post /product-review/submit containing JWT in header
```

The JWT token is valid for 15 minutes and can be used multiple times until expired.
The client should save it in the [session storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)
and request it only on expiry again.
Additionally, the API route should be rate limited to not generate too often an expensive JWT key."

In the past merchants had to deal with issues where their custom-built flow did not
behave how they intended it to do. An concrete example: We've had a merchant that contacted
us (shopware) that their shop did not sent out mails. Debugging the flow turned out to
be harder than we thought and honestly harder than it should be. The flow builder should
empower users to build reliable flows and not spend their precious time trying to
figure out what went wrong.

To improve the experience when using the Flow Builder were taking measures. First,
Flow Builder Preview and second Flow Builder Logging. This ADR only discusses the former one,
there are plans internally for the latter one, but it won't get much attention for now, as
it also addresses different issues (what does my flow do vs what went wrong in the past).

Users should be able to preview a flow and get further understanding on how a flow executes.
This preview only displays the steps and decisions happening inside a flow but doesn't
execute / simulate the real flow","## Decision 
We will implement a Flow Builder Preview feature that allows users to visualize the execution steps and decision points within a flow without actually executing or simulating it.
This preview will provide a clear, read-only representation of the flow’s behavior to help users understand the flow logic and identify potential issues before deploying it.
The preview mode will:
- Display each step and decision as they would be processed during actual execution.
- Highlight the sequence and conditions of flow transitions.
- Avoid executing any side-effects or triggering external processes.
- Provide an intuitive and transparent interface for users to explore the flow logic.
This will improve user experience by enabling users to verify that their custom-built flows behave as intended, reducing debugging efforts and increasing confidence in their configurations.","## Decision
The whole scope of the Flow Builder Preview is to help merchants *creating* new flows and

In the current media system it is possible to configure different `Shopware\Core\Content\Media\Pathname\PathnameStrategy\PathnameStrategyInterface`.

These strategies are used to store files, which are uploaded for media entity, under a certain path.

The configured strategy is then also used to generate the URL that is used in the frontend/store API to embed the file.

The generation of this URL is currently triggered in an event subscriber which is registered to the `media.loaded` event.

For generating the URL an implementation of the `UrlGeneratorInterface` is used.
```php
interface UrlGeneratorInterface
{
    public function getAbsoluteMediaUrl(MediaEntity $media): string;

    public function getRelativeMediaUrl(MediaEntity $media): string;

    public function getAbsoluteThumbnailUrl(MediaEntity $media, MediaThumbnailEntity $thumbnail): string;

    public function getRelativeThumbnailUrl(MediaEntity $media, MediaThumbnailEntity $thumbnail): string;

     * Generate the cache buster part of the path, missing from url if omitted

    public function generatePathCacheBuster(MediaEntity $media, ?MediaThumbnailEntity $thumbnail = null): ?string;

    /**
     * Generate the filename
     */
    public function generatePhysicalFilename(MediaEntity $media, ?MediaThumbnailEntity $thumbnail = null): string;
}
```","## Decision 
We will implement the URL generation for media entities by configuring a `PathnameStrategyInterface` which defines how media files are stored and how their URLs are generated.
This strategy will be responsible for producing consistent file paths and URLs, including optional elements like a hash and cache buster component, to ensure cache correctness and uniqueness.
The URL generation itself will be triggered by subscribing to the `media.loaded` event, ensuring that URL fields are populated seamlessly when media entities are loaded.
An implementation of the `UrlGeneratorInterface` will be used to abstract URL creation logic, using the configured pathname strategy internally.
This separation of concerns:
- Allows different pathname strategies to be swapped easily without changing URL generation code.
- Keeps media loading and URL enhancement decoupled via event subscription.
- Provides a clear contract via interfaces for extensibility and testing.
Future extensions may add more pathname strategies as needed to support additional storage or URL schemes.","## Decision
To address the issues listed above, we will make the following changes to the system:

- The file path will be saved directly to the media entity (and thumbnail) when the file is uploaded.
    - This way we don't have to access the strategy when generating the URL, which might have changed in the meantime.
- We allow to change the file path via API and write it directly when creating the entity
    - This way files can be synchronized directly with an external storage and the path only has to be changed in the entity or given during import.
- To generate the strategy we use new location structs, which can be easily created via a service.
    - So we remove the dependency to the DAL to generate the file path.
- For generating the URL, we implement a new service, which can be operated without entities.
    - The URL generation is more resource efficient and can be done without fully loaded entities.
- The new URL generator uses a new ""cache busting"" system, which writes the updated at timestamp of the media entity as query parameter into the URL.
    - This way the file path can remain the same even if the file is updated. Changes to the entity's meta data will also result in a new URL."

We often need a way between the different Shopware versions to provide a one-time update for data. This is currently done on the way to extend an indexer to this logic and then trigger this via a migration. 
This is of course a possible way to enable certain migrations of data, but this migration is also executed again and again when the indexer is executed. 
With certain data this is critical and can lead to system errors. For example, the one-time migration of media path information.","## Decision
We will implement a dedicated one-time data migration mechanism separate from the indexer execution process. This mechanism will:
- Allow one-time migration scripts to be registered and executed exactly once during the upgrade process.
- Ensure that these migrations are not re-executed during regular indexer runs or other routine processes.
- Maintain a migration history log or state indicator within the system to track which one-time migrations have been executed.
This approach will prevent repeated migration execution that can lead to inconsistent data or system errors, such as with sensitive data like media path information. Migrations will be triggered explicitly during upgrade or installation workflows to guarantee consistency and data integrity.","## Decision

We implement a new `PostUpdateIndexer`. This is an extension of the `EntityIndexer` and the system can be adapted 1:1. Also, the indexing registration via database migration can be adapted 1:1. 
However, the indexer is not triggered via the `IndexerRegistry` when a full re-index or an entity written event is triggered.
These indexers are only included after the update process.
In addition to the one-time update of the data, we then often also provide a command that can be used to trigger the migration of the data again."

Our current development process uses ['Experimental features'](./2023-05-10-experimental-features.md) to publish features in an early state to gather feedback regarding those features.
During the implementation, developers may encounter challenges related to the effective management of extensive code scattered throughout the platform, particularly in connection with specific experimental features. This codebase fragmentation presents impediments to the tracking, maintenance, and comprehensive understanding of each feature's scope, thereby hindering our development progress.
 
Potential problems:
* Update `stableVersion` property for Prolonged Experiments
    * When a decision is made to extend an experiment, locating all relevant sections of code for updating the property `stableVersion` in `@experimental` annotation becomes a cumbersome task.
* Deprecation of Killed Features

    * The ['Experimental features'](./2023-05-10-experimental-features.md) stipulates the ""Killing Feature"" rule, which mandates that a feature must remain within the platform's codebase until the next major version and be appropriately marked as deprecated. However, it is hardly possible to check with current annotation.

In all the above case main problem is detection to which feature belongs experimental code.","## Decision 
To improve the tracking and management of experimental feature code, we will introduce a dedicated metadata annotation mechanism that explicitly associates code elements (functions, classes, modules, etc.) with their corresponding experimental feature(s).
This annotation will allow us to:
1. Clearly identify all code tied to a given experimental feature, simplifying updates such as modifying the `stableVersion` property and marking deprecated code.
2. Maintain a central index or registry of experimental features and their associated code artifacts, enabling automated tooling and scripts to query and manipulate these associations efficiently.
3. Enforce a consistent annotation practice across the codebase, ensuring no experimental feature code goes untracked.
4. Support coexistence of multiple experimental features by tagging each experimental code segment with precise feature identifiers.
The implementation details will be:
- Define a standardized `@experimental-feature` annotation that includes attributes like feature name, status (active, prolonged, deprecated), and versions relevant to the lifecycle of the feature.
- Integrate validation into the build and review process to ensure usage consistency.
- Build developer tooling to locate all code associated with any experimental feature, facilitating easy updates and deprecations.
- Update documentation to describe the annotation usage, lifecycle policies, and expected maintenance practices.
This approach directly addresses the pain points by linking all experimental code explicitly to features, making feature lifecycle management more transparent and manageable.","## Decision
To address the existing challenges, we propose implementing a refined approach to the use of the `@experimental` annotation. 

The key modifications are as follows:
* Mandatory `feature` property: 
  * Every `@experimental` annotation will now require a mandatory `feature` property. This property is a string that must contain the name of the associated feature.
* Uniform feature Naming: 
  * To enhance code organization and traceability, all sections of code related to a particular feature must use the same feature name in the `feature` property of the `@experimental` annotation.
  * Feature names should follow the conventions.
    * Feature names cannot contain spaces
    * Feature names should be written in `ALL_CAPS`."

In the current implementation, there exists a challenge for extension developers in uniquely identifying payment and shipping methods using identifiers.
This issue is particularly significant for app servers, as it necessitates calls to the Shopware Admin API for the identification of payment and shipping methods based on their respective IDs.","## Decision 
To resolve the challenge of uniquely identifying payment and shipping methods for extension developers and app servers, we will introduce a standardized global identifier scheme for these methods.
This scheme will ensure that each payment and shipping method has a unique and stable identifier that does not require additional calls to the Shopware Admin API.
Concretely:
- Payment and shipping methods will be assigned globally unique string identifiers at creation or registration time by the platform.
- These identifiers will be exposed through the extension and app server APIs, allowing clients to reference methods unambiguously.
- The platform will maintain a mapping between these global identifiers and their internal numeric IDs, abstracting the underlying database keys.
- Extension developers will use these global identifiers to register, configure, and manage payment and shipping methods.
- App servers will be able to work exclusively with these global identifiers, eliminating the need to query the Admin API for method lookups.
This approach improves performance, reduces API dependency, and simplifies extension development and integration.","## Decision
We will introduce a new property called `technicalName` to both the `payment_method` and `shipping_method` entities.
This `technicalName` property will serve as a unique identifier for payment and shipping methods, significantly simplifying the identification process.

While the `technicalName` field will be optional within the database and API to ensure backward compatibility, it will be made mandatory in the Administration.
This ensures that merchants will update their payment and shipping methods accordingly for the upcoming requirement.
An unique index will ensure uniqueness.
Starting from version 6.7.0.0, this `technicalName` field will also become required within the database and the API.

As part of the database migration process, the `technicalName` field will be automatically generated for the default payment and shipping methods provided by Shopware, as illustrated below:

| Type     | Name             | Technical Name          |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Payment  | Debit            | payment_debitpayment    |
| Payment  | Invoice          | payment_invoicepayment  |
| Payment  | Cash on Delivery | payment_cashpayment     |
| Payment  | Pre Payment      | payment_prepayment      |
| Shipping | Standard         | shipping_standard       |
| Shipping | Express          | shipping_express        |

Furthermore, all payment and shipping methods provided by apps will also benefit from the automatic generation of their `technicalName`.
This generation will be based on the app's name and the `identifier` defined for the payment method in the manifest:

| App Name | Identifier         | Technical Name                    |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| MyApp    | my_payment_method  | payment_MyApp_my_payment_method   |
| MyApp    | my_shipping_method | shipping_MyApp_my_shipping_method |"
"## Context

At the moment the Storefront is implementing a lot of custom SCSS inside `app/storefront/src/scss`.
Some custom SCSS is not necessary, and it already exists within Bootstrap as a utility.
For example default spacing with a custom selector:

```scss
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
    margin-bottom: $spacer;
}
```

This can be replaced with a Bootstrap [spacing utility](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/spacing/) in the HTML and the SCSS can be completely removed:

```diff
- <div class=""register-login-collapse-toogle""><div>
+ <div class=""register-login-collapse-toogle mb-3""><div>
```

A class like `register-login-collapse-toogle` should stay in the HTML in case a developer wants to style this specific element.
But there is no need to introduce a new CSS rule using a custom selector to apply a default spacing.

If you implement new UI using mostly utility classes, please consider to still add CSS classes that offer the possibility for themes to add individual styling. For example:

```html
<!-- Classes ""shipping-modal-actions"", ""shipping-abort"" and ""shipping-submit"" are added for better semantics and CSS extensibility, but ship no default CSS. -->
<div class=""border p-3 mb-3 shipping-modal-actions"">
    <button class=""btn btn-light shipping-abort"">Abort</button>
    <button class=""btn btn-primary shipping-submit"">Submit</button>
</div>
```

This principle cannot be applied everywhere. 
For more complex layouts it can still be valid to use custom SCSS because it is not possible to build with default components and utilities, or it would produce a messy template with too many generic utility classes. 
However, for simpler stuff like ""add a border here, add some spacing there"" it's not necessary to implement additional custom styling.","## Decision
We will prioritize the use of Bootstrap utility classes for common styling needs such as spacing, borders, and simple visual adjustments in the Storefront UI. Custom SCSS should be minimized and only used when:
- The required style cannot be achieved with Bootstrap utilities without making the markup excessively complex or messy.
- Specific custom styling is needed for unique components or complex layouts that utilities cannot adequately address.

However, semantic and descriptive CSS classes should still be added to HTML elements to support:
- Theming and customization by allowing targeted overrides and extensions.
- Clear structure and meaningful selectors even when utility classes provide base styling.

This approach balances maintainability, clarity, and extensibility by reducing unnecessary custom SCSS while preserving the flexibility for bespoke styling needs. Developers should refactor existing custom SCSS where possible to use Bootstrap utilities with semantic classes, especially for simple style cases like margins or paddings.","## Decision

We want to make more use of Bootstrap utilities and get rid of custom SCSS that is not needed.

In order to do so we want to remove unneeded SCSS and add a utility class to the HTML instead (e.g. `mb-3`).
However, this can break styling overrides of themes/apps because most Bootstrap utility classes apply `!important` by default.

Let's stick to the example of `.register-login-collapse-toogle`.
* The core Storefront adds a bottom margin of `$spacer` which equals `1rem`.
* Then `CustomTheme` overrides this selector with a margin bottom of `80px`:

```diff
/* CustomTheme */
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
+    margin-bottom: 80px;
}

/* Storefront */
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
-    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

If the core Storefront would migrate to the utility class it would suddenly overrule the styling of `CustomTheme` because of the `!important` property:

```diff
/* Utility class from HTML overrules CustomTheme */
.mb-3 {
+    margin-bottom: 1rem !important;
}

/* CustomTheme */
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
-    margin-bottom: 80px;
}

/* Storefront */
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
-    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

The theme developer would have no other choice other than using `!important` as well, or modifying the Twig template.

Because of this, we have decided to remove the `!important` from Bootstrap utility classes by changing the [Importance](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/api/#importance) variable `$enable-important-utilities` to `false`.
By doing this, we can use more utilities while at the same time allowing themes to override the same CSS property without using `!important` or editing the template.

Since it is currently expected that Bootstrap utilities add `!important` and overrule almost everything, we do not want to change this right away but from `v6.6.0` onwards."

For our ambitions to consequently reduce manual testing in favour for test automation the current E2E test suite, based on Cypress, is not sufficient anymore. It has several flaws that have become a big road-blocker. The test suite is tightly coupled to the state of the test environment, which leads to tests that are not very deterministic and tend to be slow and flaky. Tests are often created in different ways and don't follow a specific strategy. In addition, the test suite is currently not able to test against our cloud environment.

Our goal is to create a test suite that fulfills the following requirements:

*  Deterministic tests that can run against any environment.
*  Fast and reliable tests that follow a certain test strategy.
*  Tests that are derived from real product requirements and validate behaviour.
*  A test framework that is easy to learn and using a readable syntax that also non-tech people can comprehend.","## Decision
We will adopt a behavior-driven development (BDD) style testing framework for our E2E tests to address current limitations and meet our goals. This framework will use a domain-specific language with natural language syntax to write test scenarios derived from real product requirements. Key aspects of the decision:

- Adopt a BDD framework such as Cucumber or an equivalent that supports Gherkin syntax, enabling test scenarios to be written in a human-readable form.
- Define clear and consistent guidelines for writing deterministic tests that focus on isolated, repeatable behavior rather than depending on environment state.
- Ensure tests can be run against any environment, including local, staging, and cloud, by abstracting environment-specific details and injecting test data as needed.
- Optimize for test speed and reliability by designing small focused scenarios, utilizing appropriate mocking or stubbing, and implementing parallel test execution where possible.
- Provide documentation and training so both technical and non-technical stakeholders can contribute by writing or reviewing test scenarios, improving shared understanding and collaboration.
- Deprecate the current Cypress test suite gradually and migrate high-value tests to the new framework with priority on critical behaviors.

This decision aligns with our goals of deterministic, fast, reliable tests driven by product requirements, and a readable, easy-to-learn syntax suitable for cross-functional teams.","## Decision
In order to achieve this goal we decided to not further invest time in the existing test suite, but start from scratch. This offers the opportunity to also switch to another test framework that better fulfills our needs. 

After some evaluation we chose Playwright as the new test framework. First benchmarks have shown that it is faster and more stable than Cypress. Additionally, it is easy to learn, has very good documentation and uses a syntax that is easily to understand. It also offers the functionality of creating reusable traces, which come in handy when debugging failing tests from pipelines."
"## Context
1. If flow actions want to interact with the database in a transactional manner, they need to handle it themselves by starting and committing transactions.

2. When there is a problem committing the transaction, the error will be caught and ignored by the flow dispatcher. A vague error message will be logged, but the flows will continue to execute.
This is problematic if a transaction was already started before the flow is executed. If the connection is configured without save points (which is the default with Shopware), when a nested commit fails (eg during a flow action) the connection will be marked as rollback only.
When the outer transaction attempts to commit, eg the calling code, it will be unaware of the previous inner commit failure and thus will also fail.","## Decision  
We will mandate that all transactional database interactions within flow actions must explicitly manage their own transactions, including starting, committing, and rolling back as needed.
To improve error handling:
- The flow dispatcher will be enhanced to detect commit failures during flow action execution.
- Rather than silently catching and ignoring commit errors, the dispatcher will propagate meaningful error information upstream.
- When a nested transaction commit fails, the failure state will be tracked so that any outer transactions are made aware of prior errors and can respond accordingly (e.g., by preventing a commit or triggering a rollback).
- Save points or similar mechanisms should be employed where supported to allow safer nested transactional behavior.
This approach ensures that transactional failures within flows do not pass silently, reducing the risk of unnoticed data inconsistencies or downstream transaction failures. It also makes error handling explicit and visible to calling code, which can then react appropriately.","## Decision

We introduce a new marker interface `\Shopware\Core\Content\Flow\Dispatching\TransactionalAction` which flow actions can implement.

The flow executor will wrap any action in a database transaction which implements the interface.

Before:

```php
class SetOrderStateAction extends FlowAction implements DelayableAction
{
    public function handleFlow(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {
        $this->connection->beginTransaction();
        
        //do stuff
        
        try {
            $this->connection->commit();
        } catch (\Throwable $e) {
                
        }
    }
}
```

After:

```php

class SetOrderStateAction extends FlowAction implements DelayableAction, TransactionalAction
{
    public function handleFlow(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {        
        //do stuff - will be wrapped in a transaction
    }
}
```

You can also force the flow executor to rollback the transaction by throwing an instance of `\Shopware\Core\Content\Flow\Dispatching\TransactionFailedException`. You can use the static `because` method to create the exception from another one. Eg:

```php

class SetOrderStateAction extends FlowAction implements DelayableAction, TransactionalAction
{
    public function handleFlow(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {        
        try {
            //search for some record
            $entity = $this->repo->find(...);
        } catch (NotFoundException $e) {
            throw TransactionFailedException::because($e);
        }
    }
}
```

The transaction will be rollback if either of the following are true:

1. If Doctrine throws an instance of `Doctrine\DBAL\Exception` during commit.
2. If the action throws an instance of `TransactionFailedException` during execution.
3. If another non-handled exception is thrown during the action execution. This is to aid debugging.

If the transaction fails, then the error will be logged. Also, if the transaction has been performed inside a nested transaction without save points enabled, the exception will be rethrown.
So that the calling code knows something went wrong and is able to handle it correctly, by rolling back instead of committing. As, in this instance, the connection will be marked as rollback only."
"## Context

Vue 3 introduced a new compatibility mode to ease the migration from Vue 2 to Vue 3. This mode is enabled by default
and allows the use of most Vue 2 features in a Vue 3 application. This mode is only recommended for the transition period
and should be turned off as soon as possible.

We have kept the compatibility mode enabled in the administration because it makes it easier for plugins to migrate 
and results in fewer breaking changes during the major release. This splits the work of migrating the administration
and the plugins into two separate majors instead of one.","## Decision 
We will keep the Vue 3 compatibility mode enabled for the administration interface during the current major release cycle. This approach allows plugin developers to migrate their codebases incrementally, reducing the scope and risk of the upgrade process. 
Enabling compatibility mode by default will:
- Minimize breaking changes in the administration upfront.
- Enable a smoother, phased migration path for both administration and plugins.
- Provide plugin developers the time and flexibility to update their plugins without blocking the main administration migration.
We will plan to disable the compatibility mode as soon as the majority of plugins have been updated and the administration is stable on Vue 3 native APIs, ideally no later than the subsequent major version after this one. This ensures we eventually move towards fully embracing Vue 3 without legacy compatibility layers, improving performance and maintainability in the long term.","## Decision

Migrating all components in one by disabling the compatibility mode for the whole administration is a huge task and
would make it hard to keep the administration stable during the migration. We decided to disable the compatibility mode
per component level. This allows us to migrate components one by one and keep the administration stable during the migration.

This gives all teams and plugin developers the possibility to migrate their components to Vue 3 without waiting for the
whole administration to be migrated and for the global removal of the compatibility mode.

To activate the new mode, the `DISABLE_VUE_COMPAT` feature flag must be enabled. Then, it is possible to disable the
compatibility mode on a per-component level by setting the `compatConfig` option in the component to our custom configuration.
This custom configuration is exposed in `Shopware.compatConfig` and has all compatibility features disabled if the 
feature flag is activated."

It was brought to our attention that the latest version of Vuex `4.1.0` contains a bug that destroys getter reactivity under specific circumstances. The proposed fix was to downgrade to `4.0.2`. However, downgrading was not possible as `4.0.2` contains other bugs that caused modules to fail.","## Decision
We will not downgrade the Vuex version to 4.0.2 due to stability issues and introduced bugs in that version. Instead, we will continue to use Vuex 4.1.0 while implementing workarounds or patches for the getter reactivity bug where needed. Additionally, we will monitor Vuex releases closely and evaluate upgrading to a fixed version as soon as it becomes available. Temporary mitigation strategies include avoiding the specific use cases that trigger the bug or implementing custom reactive wrappers until an official fix is released.","## Decision

In our current architecture, we rely heavily on PHP decoration, Adapter, and Factory patterns to allow for extensions and customizations by third-party developers. While these patterns are effective, they present significant challenges:

1. **Backward and Forward Compatibility:**
    - Maintaining backward and forward compatibility with these patterns is complex and labor-intensive. Each change or update can potentially break existing extensions or require extensive rework to ensure compatibility.

2. **Process Extension Limitations:**
    - These patterns do not inherently allow for the extension of subprocesses unless these subprocesses are extracted into separate classes and interfaces. This extraction often results in a proliferation of interfaces, abstract classes, and their implementations.

3. **Proliferation of Code:**
    - The need to extract subprocesses into separate entities leads to an overwhelming number of interfaces and abstract classes. This proliferation makes the codebase more difficult to understand and maintain, and increases the cognitive load on developers.","## Decision 
We will transition from relying primarily on PHP decoration, Adapter, and Factory patterns to a more composition-based architecture centered around explicit, well-defined extension points using configuration and metadata.
To address backward and forward compatibility, we will:
- Design extension points with stable, versioned interfaces.
- Use configuration-driven plugin registration rather than inheritance or decoration alone, allowing third-party extensions to register and modify behavior without tightly coupling to internal class hierarchies.
To handle subprocess extension limitations, we will:
- Avoid extracting subprocesses solely for extensibility. Instead, expose well-defined hooks or events at granular process stages that extensions can subscribe to or override.
- Encapsulate common subprocess behaviors into composable components that can be combined or replaced via configuration.
To reduce code proliferation and complexity, we will:
- Limit the number of interfaces and abstract classes by favoring metadata-driven composition over deep inheritance chains.
- Provide clear documentation and tooling around extension points to reduce cognitive load.
This approach aims to make the architecture more flexible, maintainable, and easier to understand while supporting robust third-party extension.","## Decision

To address these challenges, we have decided to transition to an event-based extension system. This new approach will replace the existing decoration, Adapter, and Factory patterns as the primary method for extending and customizing our system."

Currently, our component tests in Jest are running with enabled compat mode. To remove the compat mode for each
component, we need to add a new Jest runner with disabled compat mode to make sure that the tests are running without compat mode.","## Decision
We will introduce a new Jest test runner configuration with the compat mode disabled, alongside the existing runner with compat mode enabled. This approach allows running component tests in both modes independently.

The workflow will be:
1. Create a new Jest runner configuration file that disables compat mode.
2. Update the test scripts and CI configurations to run tests with both the existing compat mode runner and the new non-compat mode runner.
3. Over time, gradually migrate components to be compatible with the non-compat mode runner.
4. Once all components successfully pass tests without compat mode, remove the compat mode runner and associated configuration.

This decision ensures backward compatibility during the transition, maintains test coverage, and provides a clear path to fully removing compat mode in component tests.","## Decision

I added a new runner command in the NPM scripts to run the Jest tests without compat mode. The new runner command is
`unit:disabled-compat` and `unit-watch:disabled-compat`. Also, the composer commands are added to run the tests. These commands are `admin:unit:disabled-compat` and `admin:unit-watch:disabled-compat`. These commands are using the environment variable `DISABLE_JEST_COMPAT_MODE` to disable the compat mode.

For the pipeline, I added a new stage to run the Jest tests without compat mode. The stage is `Jest (Administration with disabled compat mode)`.

To mark a test file working without the compat mode you need to add a comment with the `@group` tag. The tag is `@group disabledCompat`.

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * @package admin
 * @group disabledCompat
 */

import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils';

async function createWrapper() {
...
```

With this tag, the test file is running without compat mode. To make a component working for both modes, you can use the
compatUtils helper function from Vue compat:
```javascript
// Example
import { compatUtils } from '@vue/compat';

...

if (compatUtils.isCompatEnabled('INSTANCE_LISTENERS')) {
    return this.$listeners;
}

return {};

...
```


Important: the test still runs also with compat mode activated in parallel."

System health checks are a way to monitor the health of a system and detect failures early.","## Decision 
We will implement a comprehensive system health check framework for all major components within the software system. Each component will expose health endpoints or interfaces that report their current status based on defined criteria including availability, performance, and error rates.
The health check system will:
1. Aggregate the health status of individual components to produce an overall system health status.
2. Differentiate between critical and non-critical components, so that the overall system can still be considered healthy if non-critical components exhibit issues.
3. Be integrated into the deployment pipeline and runtime monitoring tools to provide early detection of failures.
4. Allow for configurable health check intervals and thresholds to suit the operational needs and tolerance for downtime.
5. Provide transparent and accessible health data for both automated systems and human operators to review.
This approach ensures early detection of errors or degraded states prior to or shortly after rollout, improving system reliability and enabling timely intervention.","## Decision

To be able to unit test the upcoming major feature in other plugins we will enable the possibility to add other
namespaces to
the `Shopware\Core\Test\PHPUnit\Extension\FeatureFlag\Subscriber\TestPreparationStartedSubscriber`.

We'll add a static method called `addNamespace()` method to the
`Shopware\Core\Test\PHPUnit\Extension\FeatureFlag\FeatureFlagExtension` and by this we are able to add other namespaces
to the allowlist of the namespaces to be considered when enabling the major flags in the unit test suite.

Our Vue.js application currently uses the Options API, which is the traditional way of writing Vue components in Vue 2. With the release of Vue 3, the Composition API was introduced, offering improved code organization, better TypeScript support, and enhanced reusability of component logic. For more detailed information about the reasons for migrating to the Composition API, see the [documentation entry](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/administration/system-updates/vue-native.html).

To modernize our codebase and take advantage of these benefits, we need to migrate our existing Vue 2 Options API components to use the Vue 3 Composition API. Manual conversion of numerous components would be time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, we need an automated solution to assist in this migration process.","## Decision 
We will adopt an automated migration toolchain to convert our existing Vue.js components from the Options API to the Vue 3 Composition API. This toolchain will be designed to parse Vue 2 components, analyze their Options API usage patterns, and output functionally equivalent Vue 3 components using the Composition API.
Key elements of this decision include:
- Use of official or community-supported migration utilities prioritized for reliability and maintainability.
- Integration of the migration tool into our CI/CD pipeline to facilitate incremental migration and verification.
- Maintaining thorough automated testing coverage to validate that converted components preserve existing behaviors.
- Provision of documentation and developer training on Composition API patterns to ease transition and maintain code quality post-migration.
By using an automated solution, we achieve consistent, scalable, and less error-prone migration to Vue 3 Composition API, aligning with our goals to modernize the codebase and improve maintainability.","## Decision

We have decided to implement a Codemod in the form of an ESLint rule to automatically convert Vue 2 Options API components to Vue 3 Composition API. This Codemod will:

1. Identify Vue component definitions in the codebase.
2. Convert the following Options API features to their Composition API equivalents:
    - Convert `data` properties to `ref` or `reactive`.
    - Convert `computed` properties to `computed()` functions.
    - Convert `methods` to regular functions within the `setup()` function.
    - Convert lifecycle hooks to their Composition API equivalents (e.g., `mounted` to `onMounted`).
    - Convert Vue 2 specific lifecycle hooks to their Vue 3 equivalents.
    - Convert `watch` properties to `watch()` functions.
    - Handle `props` and `inject` conversions.
    - Replace `this` references with direct references to reactive variables.
    - Convert writable computed properties.
    - Handle reactive object reassignments using `Object.assign`
    - Handle correct usage of `ref` and replace the access to the value with `.value`.

3. Generate a `setup()` function containing the converted code.
4. Add necessary imports for Composition API functions (e.g., `ref`, `reactive`, `computed`, `watch`).

The Codemod will be implemented as an ESLint rule to leverage the existing ESLint ecosystem and allow for easy integration into our development workflow."

The current block system relies on TwigJs for creating reusable and extendable component template.

Moving blocks from TwigJs to Vue.js creates consistency in the technology stack, simplifying development and reducing the cognitive load on developers who previously had to switch between TwigJs and Vue.js.

2. **Improved Flexibility**: With Vue.js blocks we have control over the provided access to the componentÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂ¯s internals, allowing for more granular control over block behavior and content.

This asterisk refers to the tax and shipping costs information in the page footer `* All prices incl. VAT plus shipping costs and possible delivery charges, if not stated otherwise.`

Using the asterisk `*` next to every price has several downsides that we want to address:","## Decision  
We will replace the asterisk `*` notation next to product prices with a clearer and more user-friendly method of displaying tax and shipping information. Specifically:

1. Remove the asterisk `*` from all product prices displayed in the Storefront.
2. Instead, provide explicit labels or tooltips near or around prices that inform users about tax and shipping cost inclusions or exclusions.
3. In the page footer or a prominent notice area, maintain detailed information about tax, shipping, and possible delivery charges but without relying on the asterisk reference.
4. Where possible, integrate dynamic price breakdowns or popups that show price components (base price, tax, shipping, etc.) to improve transparency.
5. Update all related documentation and UI components to reflect this change.

This approach improves user experience by reducing confusion caused by the asterisk and making pricing information more transparent and accessible.","## Decision

The asterisk `*` next to every price will be removed because of the reasons mentioned above.
In most areas of the Storefront, the information that the asterisk `*` refers to is already given, and it is therefore redundant.
In areas where the asterisk `*` was actually needed, it will be replaced by the actual text ""Prices incl. VAT plus shipping costs"" instead to resolve the accessibility issues."

To comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), we aim to make Shopware 6's document solution accessible (A11y-compliant). This ensures that our solution remains usable while meeting legal requirements and making documents accessible to customers with disabilities. 

Currently, our PDF generation library, DomPDF, does not meet accessibility standards, posing a significant challenge.","## Decision 
We will replace DomPDF with an alternative PDF generation library that supports creating WCAG-compliant accessible PDFs. 
The evaluation criteria for selecting a new library will prioritize:
1. Support for semantic tagging and accessible PDF features (e.g., tagged PDFs, proper reading order).
2. Compatibility with our existing document solution and ability to integrate with Shopware 6.
3. Ongoing maintenance and community support.
We will conduct a technical evaluation of candidate libraries, including testing accessibility features and ease of integration, before finalizing the choice.
Once selected, we will refactor our document generation pipeline to use the new library exclusively for PDF creation.
During the transition, accessibility checks will be included in our quality assurance process to verify compliance.
This approach ensures our document solution aligns with A11y standards and legal requirements without compromising functionality.","## Decision

We have decided to make HTML documents available in addition to PDF documents, as these are more accessible.

- **Better for Accessibility**: HTML is naturally organized, making it easier for accessibility tools to read and present content to people with disabilities.

- **Lack of Support**: As our current PDFs lack support for accessibility. Few tools, especially in PHP, can create accessible tagged PDFs, making it difficult to maintain PDF accessibility.

- **Industry Trends**: Many organizations are already moving from PDFs to HTML for accessibility. For example, government websites have been required to meet accessibility standards since the early 2000s. Most of them now use HTML for most of their content because it meets these standards better.

Providing HTML documents aligns with these trends and ensures we are using best practices for accessibility."

The existing rule system is flexible but complex, making it difficult to evolve and maintain. Allowing unrestricted extensions of rule classes slows down improvements and increases the complexity of the system.

See RFC: https://github.com/shopware/shopware/discussions/5785","## Decision
We will refactor the existing rule system to limit and better control rule class extensions in order to reduce complexity and improve maintainability. Specifically:
- Define a clear, stable core set of rule classes that cover common use cases.
- Restrict the ability to extend or create new rule classes to well-reviewed extension points with strict guidelines.
- Encourage composition and configuration of existing rules over creating new classes wherever possible.
- Deprecate or remove seldom-used or redundant rule classes to streamline the system.
- Establish a formal review and testing process for any new rule class extensions to ensure quality and consistency.
This approach balances flexibility with simplicity, enabling the rule system to evolve reliably while minimizing technical debt.","## Decision
We will mark existing rule classes as internal, limiting direct usage by third parties. Developers should create new rule classes instead of modifying existing ones. 

Nearly all rule classes will be marked as internal, with a few exceptions: 

```
LineItemOfTypeRule
LineItemProductStatesRule
PromotionCodeOfTypeRule
ZipCodeRule
BillingZipCodeRule
ShippingZipCodeRule
```

These classes will remain public for now, because they rely on configuration which is reasonably expected to be extended by third-party developers."

The Storefront JavaScript currently offers a helper class `src/helper/iterator.helper.js` that can iterate over different objects like Maps, FormData, plain arrays etc.
Using this approach has several downsides we want to address.

* It creates an unnecessary abstraction over the native alternative. Very often the `Iterator.iterate()` directly uses js plain `forEach` loop without any additional logic. Using the abstraction is actually creating more complexity.
* It prevents the developer from using the appropriate loop for the given data type and instead passes it to an iterator that does it with arbitrary data types.
* The iterator is a special shopware syntax that needs to be understood and documented. It is way easier to use web standards that everyone knows and that is also officially documented already.
* The usage throughout the codebase is inconsistent and the iterator helper is used alongside the native loops which can create confusion.
* It creates the impression that the data that is being iterated is some special custom object that needs a special iterator helper. In reality, it is a simple `NodeList` in 90% of the time.
* It creates an additional dependency/import in every file that is using it.","## Decision  
We will deprecate and remove the `Iterator` helper class from the Storefront JavaScript codebase. Instead, developers should use native JavaScript iteration methods appropriate to the data structure being processed, such as plain `forEach` loops, `for...of` loops, or other iterable protocols.

This decision aims to:  
- Reduce unnecessary abstraction and complexity introduced by the custom iterator.  
- Encourage usage of standard, well-documented JavaScript iteration constructs known to all developers.  
- Improve consistency across the codebase by eliminating mixed usage of the iterator helper and native constructs.  
- Remove the false impression that certain objects require special handling when they are standard JavaScript collections like NodeLists.  
- Reduce dependencies and imports by avoiding the iterator helper altogether.  

To implement this, we will:  
- Identify all current uses of the `Iterator` helper and refactor them to use native iteration mechanisms appropriate to the data type.  
- Update developer documentation and coding guidelines to explicitly recommend native iteration approaches and discourage use of the iterator helper.  
- Remove the `src/helper/iterator.helper.js` module once all references have been replaced.  

This change will simplify developer experience, improve code clarity, and align the codebase with modern JavaScript best practices.","## Decision

For all the above reasons we have decided to deprecate `src/helper/iterator.helper.js`, stop using it, and use native alternatives instead.
We want to have a more lean and simple Storefront JavaScript that needs less special things to learn and understand."
"## Context

Currently, flows are executed during the business process. A business
process is any event that is triggered by the user, like a checkout or
a product update. Flows are used to react to these events and execute user defined actions.

There are several downsides to this approach. The most straightforward is the possibility of a fatal error during
the execution of any flow. This will inevitably cancel the in progress business process. While there are remedies in place
to avoid any trivial errors in flow execution disrupting the business process, certain errors can not be avoided.

Further, even if all flows execute without error, they noticeably impact business process performance. Flows are often 
employed to, for example, send mails, an expensive operation that is not necessary to complete the business process.

In addition to these concrete disadvantages, there are also some more abstract ones. For one, currently flows are executed directly
from a decorator of Symfony's `EventDispatcher`, leading to cumbersome debugging and bloated stack traces. This would
be improved if flows are executed by a dedicated event listener. Additionally moving flows to their own execution
environment would not only simplify debugging, but also potentially make expanding their capabilities easier.

> *The following is all experimental and only takes effect if the associated feature flag `FLOW_EXECUTION_AFTER_BUSINESS_PROCESS` is enabled*","## Decision 
We will decouple the execution of flows from the main business process execution by introducing an asynchronous processing model.
When the feature flag `FLOW_EXECUTION_AFTER_BUSINESS_PROCESS` is enabled, flows triggered by user events will no longer execute inline during the business process.
Instead, the business process will emit events that are picked up by a dedicated flow execution environment running in parallel or subsequently.
This separate execution environment will be implemented as dedicated event listeners or workers that handle flow execution asynchronously.
The benefits include:
- Preventing fatal errors in flow execution from interrupting or cancelling the business process.
- Improving overall business process performance by offloading expensive operations, such as sending emails, to post-process flow execution.
- Simplifying debugging by removing flow execution from the core event dispatch stack and reducing stack trace complexity.
- Facilitating future extensibility and capability expansion for flows by isolating their execution environment.
To support this transition:
- The system will ensure reliable event dispatch from the business process to the asynchronous flow processor.
- Flow execution status and errors will be logged and tracked separately to enable monitoring and troubleshooting.
- The existing synchronous flow execution mechanism will remain available and enabled by default unless the feature flag is set.
- Comprehensive testing will verify behavior with the feature flag both enabled and disabled to ensure backward compatibility and stability.","## Decision


We will move the flow execution after the business process. As outlined above we believe that this will simplify the
development around flows, while also improving their performance and safeguarding the main execution environment.

To ensure that flows are executed as close to the business process that triggered them as possible, we will
'queue' the flow execution. This means that flows will be executed after the business process has finished.
Flows are stored in memory and executed as soon as the execution environment signals, that it has
finished a unit of work. The associated events are as follows:

1. After a controller action has been executed (Web) => `KernelEvents::TERMINATE`
2. After a queued message has been processed (Queue) => `WorkerMessageHandledEvent`
3. After a command has been executed (CLI) => `ConsoleEvents::TERMINATE`

Another option would be to handle flow executions as queue messages. This would entirely remove
flow executions from the runtime of the business process. While this would be a simpler solution,
it would both make debugging more complex and introduce an unpredictable delay between the business
process and the flow execution. While this delay could be mitigated by using a high priority queue,
it could not reliably be kept under a certain threshold. To entirely avoid this delay, we decided
that the flow execution should be handled as close to the business process as possible."

We want to record architectural decisions made in this project.
Which format and structure should these records follow?","## Decision 
We will adopt the Architecture Decision Record (ADR) format for documenting architectural decisions in this project.

- Title: A succinct summary of the decision.
- Context: The background and trigger for the decision.
- Decision: A clear statement of the choice made.
- Consequences: The implications and effects of the decision.
ADR files will be stored in a dedicated directory within the project repository (e.g., /doc/adr or /docs/adr), named sequentially (e.g., 0001-use-adr-format.md).
This approach ensures that architectural decisions are documented systematically, enabling transparency, traceability, and ease of revisiting or updating decisions over time.","## Decision Outcome

"## Context and Problem Statement

The Metadata API provides a modern Python API for accessing individual pieces
of metadata. It does not provide any wider context help to someone looking to
implement a TUF repository.

The legacy python-tuf implementation offers tools for this but suffers from
some issues (as do many other implementations):
* There is a _very_ large amount of code to maintain: repo.py,
  repository_tool.py and repository_lib.py alone are almost 7000 lines of code.
* The ""library like"" parts of the implementation do not form a good coherent
  API: methods routinely have a large number of arguments, code still depends
  on globals in a major way and application (repo.py) still implements a lot of
  ""repository code"" itself
* The ""library like"" parts of the implementation make decisions that look like
  application decisions. As an example, repository_tool loads _every_ metadata
  file in the repository: this is fine for CLI that operates on a small
  repository but is unlikely to be a good choice for a large scale server.","## Decision
We will refactor the existing python-tuf repository implementation by splitting responsibilities clearly between the API layer and the repository management layer to improve maintainability, clarity, and scalability:
1. The Metadata API will remain focused on providing a clean, modern interface for accessing individual pieces of metadata without imposing application-level decisions.
2. We will isolate repository management logic into a separate component that orchestrates loading, validation, and updating of metadata, removing global dependencies and minimizing large argument lists.
3. Repository management logic will be designed to allow flexible loading strategies (e.g., lazy loading or partial loading of metadata) to support both small CLI use cases and large-scale server applications.
4. We will refactor and reduce code duplication by consolidating overlapping functionality from repo.py, repository_tool.py, and repository_lib.py into modular, well-defined classes and functions.
5. The overall structure will emphasize clear separation of concerns, enabling each layer to evolve independently and to facilitate easier testing and maintenance.
This approach will reduce complexity, improve transparency of operations, and better support diverse usage scenarios of the TUF repository implementation.","## Decision Drivers

* There is a consensus on removing the legacy code from python-tuf due to
  maintainability issues
* Metadata API makes modifying metadata far easier than legacy code base: this
  makes significantly different designs possible
* Not providing a ""repository library"" (and leaving implementers on their own)
  may be a short term solution because of the previous point, but to make
  adoption easier and to help adopters create safe implementations the project
  would benefit from some shared repository code and a shared repository design 
* Maintainability of new library code must be a top concern
* Allowing a wide range of repository implementations (from CLI tools to
  minimal in-memory implementations to large scale application servers)
  would be good: unfortunately these can have wildly differing requirements"

Primer React components was originally released without TypeScript type definitions, making it difficult for engineers to consume the library in TypeScript applications. In [July 2019](https://github.com/primer/react/commit/2983c935ea9ad600c04078adb25e40c3624c11fa#diff-7aa4473ede4abd9ec099e87fec67fd57afafaf39e05d493ab4533acc38547eb8), we created an [ambient declaration](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/typescript-ambients-declaration/) file (`index.d.ts`) file to provide type definitions for TypeScript applications without having to rewrite Primer React components in TypeScript.

`index.d.ts` has been an effective stopgap, enabling teams to build complex applications with Primer React components and TypeScript. However, because `index.d.ts` is disconnected from the implementation code, we've struggled to keep the type definitions up-to-date and accurate, as evidenced by [many](https://github.com/primer/react/issues/906) [TypeScript](https://github.com/primer/react/issues/540) [bug](https://github.com/primer/react/issues/520) [reports](https://github.com/primer/react/issues/534). As the library continues to grow in size and complexity, manually maintaining type definitions will become unsustainable.","## Decision
We will migrate Primer React components to be authored in TypeScript rather than plain JavaScript. This means rewriting or incrementally converting components and associated logic to TypeScript with inline type annotations rather than relying on a separate ambient declaration `.d.ts` file.

This shift is intended to:
- Eliminate the disconnect between implementation and type declarations to improve accuracy and maintainability of types.
- Reduce the volume of TypeScript bugs arising from outdated or incorrect type declarations.
- Enable incremental migration by converting components individually, allowing coexistence of JavaScript and TypeScript during the transition.
- Leverage TypeScript tooling (such as editor support, type checking, and refactoring) directly integrated with the source code.
- Ensure long-term sustainability as the component library grows in size and complexity.

The ambient declaration file `index.d.ts` will be deprecated and eventually removed once the migration completes. In the interim, it will be maintained only for critical gaps while migration progresses.","## Decision

We will rewrite Primer React components in TypeScript."
"## Context

In Primer React and consuming applications, we use many different patterns for creating React components. Two common patterns are:

1. Creating components with styled-components

   ```tsx
   const Avatar = styled.img.attrs<StyledAvatarProps>(props => ({
     height: props.size,
     width: props.size,
   }))<StyledAvatarProps>`
     display: inline-block;
     overflow: hidden;
     line-height: ${get('lineHeights.condensedUltra')};
     border-radius: ${props => getBorderRadius(props)};
     ${sx}
   `
   ```

   [Show full code example ÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂº](https://github.com/primer/react/pull/2019/files?diff=split&w=0)

2. Creating components with Box

   ```tsx
   const Avatar: React.FC<AvatarProps> = ({size = 20, alt = '', square = false, sx = {}, ...props}) => {
     const styles: BetterSystemStyleObject = {
       display: 'inline-block',
       overflow: 'hidden',
       lineHeight: 'condensedUltra',
       borderRadius: getBorderRadius({size, square}),
     }

     return (
       <Box
         as=""img""
         alt={alt}
         sx={merge<BetterSystemStyleObject>(styles, sx)} // styles needs to merge with props.sx
         {...props}
       />
     )
   }
   ```

   [Show full code example ÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂº](https://github.com/primer/react/pull/2019/files?diff=split&w=0)

&nbsp;","## Decision
Primer React will standardize on using the Box component pattern for creating React components instead of styled-components.

Rationale:
- Using Box leverages its built-in sx prop to compose styles via JavaScript objects, providing greater flexibility and type safety.
- This fits well with design systems and theming through consistent style objects and helper functions.
- The Box pattern avoids the additional complexity and boilerplate of styled-components’ tagged template literals and attrs functions.
- It encourages clearer merging and override of styles through the sx prop, improving maintainability and extensibility.
- Box components remain simple React functional components, making them easier to understand and extend for developers familiar with React.
- This pattern better aligns with Primer React’s goals of composability, configurability, and sharing styles across components.","## Decision

Prefer using method #2: Creating components with Box for the following reasons:

- Better authoring experience with Typescript. With Box, we can improve the API and autocomplete for consuming primitives. [See research](https://github.com/github/primer/discussions/755#discussioncomment-2318144)
- The styling library (i.e. styled-components) becomes an implementation detail and can be changed later with minimal breaking changes for consumers. (Avoids leaky abstractions)
- We have had issues with exporting types, we can increase confidence by keeping the exported types close to what we author.

"## Context

`Drafts` were introduced in [ADR-006](./adrs/adr-006-drafts.md) as a way of creating components outside of the root bundle of `@primer/react`. This helps us create, test and maintain multiple versions of the same component in parallel.

Example:

```js
// default version of component exported from root of package
import {UnderlineNav} from '@primer/react'

// new version of component exported from /drafts
import {UnderlineNav} from '@primer/react/drafts'
```

We have also used this method for components that are still a work in progress and we don't want developers to start using them in production without collaborating with us first.

Example:

```js
// this component only exists in drafts and not in the roof of the package
import {TreeView} from '@primer/react/drafts'
```","## Decision 
We will continue using the concept of `Drafts` as established in ADR-006 to manage component lifecycle and versioning within `@primer/react`.
`Drafts` will serve as a dedicated export path for experimental, in-progress, or alternative versions of components that are not yet ready for production use.
This approach allows parallel development and testing without impacting the stability of the root package exports.
Developers will import stable components from the root package path and experimental or draft components from the `/drafts` path.
We will maintain clear documentation and communication to ensure teams understand which components are stable versus draft.
Continued usage of the drafts path will encourage collaboration and iterative improvement before formal promotion of components to the main exports.","## Decision

We should drop the `draft` label and use `experimental` instead.

While not completely accurate (UnderlineNav2 is much more polished than `experimental` maturity), the lack of confusion makes it a good trade-off.

Fine-grained information about component maturity, useful for maintainers, is also communicated by the [status checklist in the component documentation](https://primer.style/react/drafts/UnderlineNav2#status)."
"## Context

[Snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing) is a strategy that allows a developer to ""snapshot"" a given value within a test suite. This value could be a primitive within JavaScript, an Array, an object, or the resulting HTML of rendering a component in React. The snapshot of the value is stored within the repo and is then compared against future test runs.

When a change is detected to a snapshot, the test will fail with a diff between the currently stored snapshot and the new snapshot. Within the space of React components, this may happen when a class name changes or the markup of a component changes. Is is then up to the developer to decide if the change is intentional and whether or not to accept this new snapshot as the baseline for future test runs.

A common practice is to snapshot a React component which will capture the HTML output of rendering a component. For example:

```jsx
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer'
import Link from '../Link'

it('renders correctly', () => {
  const tree = renderer.create(<Link page=""http://www.facebook.com"">Facebook</Link>).toJSON()
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot()
})
```

```js
exports[`renders correctly 1`] = `
<a
  className=""normal""
  href=""http://www.facebook.com""
  onMouseEnter={[Function]}
  onMouseLeave={[Function]}
>
  Facebook
</a>
`
```

[Source](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing#snapshot-testing-with-jest)

As the number of snapshots within a project grows, there are a couple of challenges that emerge:

- Components with wide or deep trees emit large snapshots
- Debugging what change lead to a broken snapshot can be difficult
- It is unclear what the intent may be of a snapshot test when something does fail, in other words it does not always answer the question: what is this testing?","## Decision 
We will adopt snapshot testing for React components to capture and verify their rendered output over time.
To address challenges of large snapshots and debugging difficulty:
- Encourage writing smaller, more focused component unit tests to reduce snapshot size.
- Use descriptive test and snapshot names to clarify intent and aid diagnosis when snapshots fail.
- When a snapshot test fails, require the developer to review changes carefully, updating snapshots only if changes were intentional and correct.
- Supplement snapshot tests with additional tests that verify behavior and logic explicitly, avoiding over-reliance on snapshots alone.
This approach balances the utility of snapshot testing for detecting unintended UI changes with the need to maintain clarity and meaningfulness of test failures.","## Decision

- Avoid using ""catch-all"" snapshot tests for React components
- Snapshots may be used for static objects which have a clear signal as to what to do if they are modified (such as the exports of a package)

There are situations where we would like to provide warnings to developers who
use `@primer/react` that something may be deprecated, unsupported, etc. Often,
these will be emitted using `console.warn()`. When using `console.warn()` by
itself, we run into a situation where code that is only meant for development
is included in production code. As a result, it would be helpful to establish
patterns around how to provide warnings to developers in order to make sure
that:

- Calls to `console.warn()` do not appear in production
- Code related to development checks, warnings, or messages are removed from
  production code","## Decision
To ensure that development-only warnings such as those using `console.warn()` do not appear in production builds, we will establish a pattern of conditional compilation based on environment flags.

- All warning calls and associated development-only code will be wrapped in conditionals that check for a development environment flag, e.g., `if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production')`.
- This pattern will be consistently enforced across the codebase, especially in `@primer/react`.
- Build tooling (e.g., Webpack, Babel) will be configured to perform dead code elimination on these conditionals during production builds, removing any development-only warning code.
- Documentation and developer guidelines will encourage use of these patterns to prevent accidental inclusion of dev-only warnings in production.
- In addition, a testing step can be added to ensure no calls to `console.warn()` exist in production bundles.

This approach guarantees that:
- Development warnings are available during development for developer guidance.
- No extraneous warning code or console calls appear in production, keeping bundles lean and performant.","## Decision

Code that is meant for development-only warnings or checks **must** be wrapped within a
`__DEV__` block.

```tsx
function ExampleComponent() {
  if (__DEV__) {
    // This code only runs in development
  }
}
```

Under-the-hood, the `__DEV__` block will be compiled to a `NODE_ENV` check so
that it is stripped when `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`.

> **Note**
> Contributors may wrap hooks within a `__DEV__` block even though hooks are not
> meant to be called conditionally. This is because the `__DEV__` check can be
> considered constant in that it will always be true or false for the
> environment (development or production).

When a contributor would like to communicate a warning to a developer, they
should use the `warning()` helper.

```ts
warning(condition, 'This is the message that is logged when condition is truth-y')
```

This helper allows you to provide a `condition`. When the condition is truth-y
it will emit the message provided. This helper is automatically wrapped in a
`__DEV__` block and will be removed from production builds.

For more complex conditions, a contributor may combine `console.warn()` with
`__DEV__` when `warning()` does not suffice."

There are several components in Primer React that make use of live regions.
However, the library does not have a central pattern for making accessible live
region announcements. This ADR documents the decision to use a central pattern
for live region announcements that can be used across Primer and GitHub.

ARIA Live regions fall into several buckets that we may want to use as component
authors:

- [ARIA live region roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#live_region_roles), such as `alert`, `log`, or `status`
- [The `aria-live` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-live) to turn an element into a live region

In components, we see the following scenarios in Primer React:

- Announce the contents of an element when it is rendered or on page load, like when a spinner is displayed or a form is submitted
- Announce the changes to the content of an element, like when the count inside of a
  button is incremented
- Announce a message programmatically, such as the number of results for a query

Currently, contributors may reach for roles such as `alert` or `status` to
achieve these scenarios. They may also add `aria-live=""assertive""` or `aria-live=""polite""` with an an `aria-atomic=""true""` to an element explicitly.
However, both of these approaches do not announce consistently across screen
readers. This could be due to live regions being injected dynamically into the document (this includes loading content into the document via React), dynamically changing the visibility of a live region, or some other technique causing an announcement to not be announced.

For more information about the ways in which live regions may not work as
expected, visit: [Why are my live regions not working?](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2024/05/01/why-are-my-live-regions-not-working/)","## Decision 
We will implement a centralized live region announcer component within Primer React that abstracts and standardizes live region announcements for all components.

Key aspects include:
1. A single, hidden, ARIA-compliant live region (or set of live regions) managed at the application root or a high-level component to ensure consistent behavior across screen readers.
2. A programmatic API exposed to components and application code for making announcements, specifying attributes such as:
   - `aria-live` level (`assertive`, `polite`)
   - role (`alert`, `status`, `log`)
   - message content
3. Internally, the announcer will manage the live region DOM nodes to avoid common pitfalls such as reusing DOM nodes, dynamically inserting or removing them, or visibility toggling that can interfere with announcements.
4. Components will no longer set aria-live attributes directly on their DOM nodes, but call the announcer API to make announcements when necessary.
5. This centralized approach will handle all scenarios:
   - Announcing content when it is rendered or on page load
   - Announcing dynamic content changes
   - Programmatic announcements independent of UI changes
6. Documentation and examples will be provided showing how component authors should issue announcements using the announcer API.

This decision significantly improves accessibility consistency, reduces duplicated and error-prone aria-live implementations throughout Primer React, and aligns with best practices from established accessibility guidelines and community learnings.","## Decision

In order to have a common interop point for live region announcements, Primer React will
make use of a `live-region` custom element from `@primer/live-region-element`.
This package will be included and published from the `primer/react` repo.

The custom element exposes a way to make announcements that can be used
across frameworks. This makes it useful not only for Primer but GitHub as a
whole. The `@primer/live-region-element` exports two helpers to use for making
announcements: `announce()` and `announceFromElement`. Both helpers can be used
when working in Primer and by teams at GitHub.

In addition, `@primer/react` will leverage and export the following helpers for
use within Primer React and GitHub:

- The `AriaStatus` component to correspond with `role=""status""`
- The `AriaAlert` component to correspond with `role=""alert""`

Within `@primer/react`, we should lint against usage of `aria-live` and the
corresponding roles (if possible) and suggest using these alternatives instead.

## Context,"## Decision
Given the lack of specific context or requirements, no new architectural decision will be made at this time. Architectural decisions should be driven by clear goals, constraints, or problems to solve, which are not provided in this context. Future decisions will be documented as contexts and needs become clearer.","## Decision

1. npm package: ""Experimental"" components, as defined by the component lifecycle, should not be part of semantically versioned npm package for `@primer/react`.

2. npm package: Each experimental component should be independently published and versioned with semver. Breaking changes should be tagged as major versions. Example: `@github/experimental-react-commentbox`

3. The code for experimental components should live in a new repository, example: [github/react-experimental](https://github.com/github/react-experimental) and published as individual packages as suggested in point 2.

This will help in sharing experimental components between the monolith and projects outside of monolith. The ownership and responsibility of maintenance will be shared by multiple teams (including primer)."
"## Context

Our testing infrastructure consists of Jest ""unit"" tests and automatic Chromatic visual testing. Both of these are super useful but we have been experiencing a few setbacks.
Unofficially we test more complex interactive scenarios using our storybooks setup.

1. Repeated markup in storybooks and jest tests - Since there is not automation of interaction in storybooks, we tend to test them out manually in stories and then transfer to jest. This results in us constructing similar test case scenarios in storybooks and in tests.

2. Debugging complex jest tests - There is no visual aspect to jest tests. Mostly everything is CLI based. This makes it hard to debug broken tests. Visibility into these tests is also low for people who want to enhance them.","## Decision 
We will adopt a testing approach that integrates automated interaction testing within Storybook, using tools such as Storybook Testing Library or Playwright integration.
This will allow interactive scenarios to be scripted and executed directly within the Storybook environment, reducing duplication between Storybook stories and Jest tests.
The new workflow will be:
1. Develop interactive components and scenarios as Storybook stories.
2. Write automated interaction tests alongside these stories, ensuring scenarios are both documented and tested in the same place.
3. Use visual regression testing (Chromatic) to detect unexpected UI changes.
4. Keep Jest for unit tests that do not require UI interaction or visual validation.
Benefits:
- Eliminates duplication of markup and scenario construction between Storybook and Jest.
- Provides visual and interactive debugging capabilities, as tests run in the Storybook environment.
- Makes tests more accessible and easier to understand for team members via the Storybook UI.
We will progressively migrate existing complex interaction tests from Jest to this integrated Storybook testing approach, prioritizing tests with frequent debugging difficulties or heavy UI interaction.","## Decisions

Going forward, we can use [storybook's play functions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function) to write interaction tests for our components. Here's a document that describes [how to add and run these tests](../storybook-tests.md).
Guidelines to make this easier -

1. Create a new storybook file for your components and call them ""interactions"". Inside these files, we can import the stories from ""examples"" or ""fixtures"" and tack on play functions to them. This will create duplicate stories but with the added benefit of the tests appearing in the interactions add-on tab. This tab will let you step through your tests step by step, increasing visibility and debuggability.

2. Port complex jest tests onto interactive tests. This is up to developer discretion. My recommendation is to have basic ""unit"" tests like component existence and axe tests in jest. Anything that can benefit from a visual aspect to it can be moved to interaction tests.

3. Interaction tests are not perfect. Some aspects like mocking can be challenging and we will find solutions to these as when the need arises."

> tl;dr

> We have workspaces within the project but no official way of connecting them or managing dependencies from the top-level. Similarly, scripts that grow in size or complexity have no dedicated home or ability to manage dependencies outside of the top-level workspace.

The `primer/react` repo is composed of several workspaces that use `npm` to manage dependencies. In order to install these dependencies, a contributor needs to visit each directory and run `npm install`. The project also has a convenience script for this task, invoked through `npm run setup`, that goes through this process for contributors.

These distinct workspaces may sometimes depend on each other. For example, the `docs` workspace depends on the `@primer/react` package which is defined at the top-level of the project. Similarly, examples in the `examples/*` folders may also depend on `@primer/react`. Currently these dependencies are expressed either through relative paths, file dependencies in `package.json`, or symlinks through `npm link`.

There is also a collection of scripts under the `script` directory that exist in the project that involve varying levels of complexity and depth.","## Decision 
We will adopt a monorepo approach using a dedicated tool such as `npm` workspaces or an alternative like `yarn workspaces` or `pnpm` to manage inter-workspace dependencies and streamline dependency management.
Key points of the decision:
- Centralize dependency management at the top-level workspace to reduce redundant installations.
- Express inter-workspace dependencies via workspace protocol references in `package.json` to ensure clear, semantic dependency definitions.
- Deprecate using relative paths, file dependencies, and `npm link` for workspace dependencies, as these cause fragile and non-transparent dependency graphs.
- Introduce a dedicated scripts workspace or directory with its own package.json to manage complex and growing scripts separately, with dependencies handled via workspace tooling.
- Update the root-level setup script (`npm run setup`) to delegate installation to the workspace tools to reflect the new dependency management approach.
- Document the workflow for adding/editing workspaces and scripts, detailing how to properly declare dependencies and run installation commands.
This decision will enable more transparent, maintainable, and reproducible setup and development workflows across the multiple workspaces and scripts in the project.","## Decision

Setup the project to use [`npm` workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces). This will require changing the project to have a top-level `package.json` file which will use `workspaces` to reference child workspaces. The layout for the project would then be:

```
- root
  # Root package.json, defines workspaces
  - package.json

  # Workspaces
  - docs
  - packages
    - react
    - *
  - examples
    - nextjs
    - consumer-test
    - *

  # Top-level scripts
  - script

  # Testing & Development
  - .storybook
  - .playwright

  # Repo config
  - .github
  - .vscode
```

The following items will be installed and ran at the root-level:

- Linting
  - `eslint`
  - `markdownlint`
- Testing
  - Jest
  - Playwright
- Development
  - Storybook
- Type checking
  - TypeScript

Certain configuration items, like for TypeScript or Babel, may need configuration defined at the top-level and extended by child workspaces.

The current `@primer/react` package will move to the `packages/react` package. Workspaces that depend on `@primer/react` should reference the version of that package."
"## Context

Currently all files live under the `src` directory. In the `npm` package for `@primer/react`, we specify the following export pattern:

```json5
{
  exports: {
    // ...
    './lib-esm/*': {
      import: [
        // ...
      ],
      require: [
        // ...
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

This pattern, along with our Rollup setup, opts-in files and folders under the `src` directory into the public API of the package. This means that certain parts of the codebase which aren't intended to be used outside of `@primer/react` are considered part of its public API and can be imported and used by consumers.","## Decision 
We will reorganize the codebase to clearly separate public API files from internal implementation files. 
Specifically:
1. Move all files and modules intended to be part of the public API into a dedicated `src/public` directory.
2. Keep internal-only files under `src/internal` or `src/private`, reflecting their non-exported status.
3. Adjust the `exports` field in `package.json` to explicitly export only the paths under `src/public`, preventing accidental exposure of internal files.
4. Configure Rollup and other build tools accordingly to treat only `src/public` files as entry points for bundles and exports.
5. Document this structure to inform contributors about the distinction between public and internal code, and enforce that internal files should not be imported by package consumers.
This approach will maintain a clean and controlled public API surface, reducing accidental dependencies on internal implementation details and enabling safer refactoring of internal code.","## Decision

Adopt a convention in Primer React where internal modules live in the `src/internal` folder. This folder which would include all components, hooks, and other modules which are not intended for usage outside of the project. Files within `src/internal` may be grouped by area, such as `src/internal/components`, `src/internal/hooks`, etc.

In the `""exports""` field of our `npm` package, we can then add the following pattern:

```json5
{
  exports: {
    // ...
    './lib-esm/internal/*': null,
  },
}
```

This pattern would remove any files and folders within `src/internal` from the public API of the `npm` package. This pattern is inspired by [this section](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#package-entry-points) from Node.js, specifically this example:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""my-package"",
  ""exports"": {
    ""."": ""./lib/index.js"",
    ""./feature/*.js"": ""./feature/*.js"",
    ""./feature/internal/*"": null
  }
}
```"

Reasons for change: Performance, utilise css variables

The main reason for changing our styling architecture is to remove performance issues for applications:

Relevant parts from [primer/discussions#1928](https://github.com/github/primer/discussions/1928#reasons)(Hubbers only link):

1. Initial page loads take longer

   Because styles are injected during runtime, we can not parallelize this work. The page is un-styled till the javascript bundle is
   downloaded and processed. The processing time is longer on slower devices.

   Benchmarks:

   i. Lab benchmarks: rendering a page with 1000 components
   runtime injection of css: 242ms
   static .css files: 96ms (60% faster)

   ii. Application benchmarks: render times for repo directory (>1000 files, [gh/gh#241090](https://github.com/github/github/pull/241090))
   with primer/react Box: 3800ms
   with custom css: 3076ms (20% faster)

2. Slow server side rendering

   Some applications are able to make up for slower initial render times by collecting styles on the server first. In the correct stack, collecting styles requires rendering the app twice before we can ship any html to the user.

   benchmarks: in the issues-app experiment, collecting styles on the server contributed to + 20% of rendering time (450ms on top of 1900ms)

3. Style updates are expensive

   The slowest part of the current stack is updating styles based on props or state. Big changes take linearly longer, worse on slower devices.

   Benchmarks:

   i. Lab benchmarks: updating a page with 1000 components, static runtime css vs. dynamic runtime css (thanks @mattcosta7 for these!)

   re-rendering components with fixed styles on runtime: 242ms
   re-rendering components with dynamic styles on runtime: 441ms (55% slower)

   ii. Application benchmarks: opting out of IconButton for PR diff view (>500 files, [gh/gh#243269](https://github.com/github/github/pull/243269))

   dynamic styles with sx prop: 400ms
   dynamic styles with .css files: 165ms (60% faster)

The other reasons for change are to utilise css variables for theming and improve the guardrails of consuming primer/primitives","## Decision
We will transition our styling architecture from runtime-injected dynamic styles to static CSS files utilizing CSS variables. This approach will be implemented to address multiple performance challenges including initial page load times, server-side rendering delays, and costly style updates on state or prop changes. By leveraging static CSS:

- Initial page loads will parallelize CSS fetching and avoid the delay caused by waiting for JavaScript bundle processing.
- Server-side rendering will no longer require double rendering for style collection, thus reducing render time overhead.
- Style updates will become more efficient as CSS variables and static classes provide cheaper updates compared to runtime-generated styles.

Additionally, this change will enable more effective use of CSS variables to support theming and enforce better guardrails on styling usage consistent with primer/primitives.

This decision is motivated by benchmark data demonstrating substantial performance improvements (20-60%) across different rendering scenarios and device capabilities. The transition plan includes migrating existing dynamic styles to static CSS files with CSS variable support while ensuring backward compatibility during rollout.","## Decisions

1. Manually refactor styles to css files + css modules

   Use css variables from primer/primitives for inexpensive theming support, especially with server side rendering

2. Use css modules with hash

   By importing styles in the component, we can create an explicit dependency between the two. This enables applications using primer to have control over bundling and delivery.

   To begin with, we will ship a single css bundle that can be imported in the application. (example: `import '@primer/react/styles.css'`). When needed, we have the option to delegate bundling of css files to the application (they can be split by page or bundled as a common chunk for all react pages to share)

3. Keep styled-components underneath for supporting sx prop.

   Keep backward compatibility, we might change this in the future

Code example:

```jsx
import clsx from 'clsx'
import classNames from './ActionList.module.css'

const Button = ({className, sx, ...props}}) => {
  return (
    <Box
      as=""button""
      sx={sx}
      // it's important to pass both internal and props.className to the element
      className={clsx(classNames.ActionList, className)}
      {...props}
    >
    </Box>
  )
}
```"

> **Note**
> This ADR supercedes [`ADR 009`](./adr-009-interaction-tests.md)

We author tests using a combination of Jest and Playwright. Typically, Jest is
used for unit and integration tests and Playwright is used for Visual Regression
Tests against our Storybook.

In `ADR 009`, we proposed using Storybook's [`play`
functions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function) as
the recommended way to author tests that require tests based on user
interactions. In this ADR, we would like to revisit this decision.","## Decision 
We will no longer use Storybook's play functions as the primary method for authoring interaction tests.
Instead, we will adopt a clear separation between unit/integration tests and interaction/end-to-end tests:
- Continue using Jest for unit and integration tests where component logic and behavior are tested in isolation.
- Use Playwright directly for writing interaction and end-to-end tests that simulate user flows and visual regression testing.
This approach aligns better with best practices and tool strengths:
- Play functions are not designed for comprehensive interaction or e2e testing and have limitations in testing complex user flows.
- Using Playwright explicitly for interaction tests provides more control, better debugging, and clearer test organization.
This decision supersedes ADR 009 and reflects our commitment to maintainable, transparent, and effective testing strategies.","## Decision

For tests involving interaction, use Playwright to visit a storybook story and
interact with the component directly. This will allow for easy integration with
Visual Regression Testing and our automated accessibility testing (through axe).
In order to perform interactions, use [actions from
Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/input)."
"## Context

There are situations where a component prop can support a value or a ""responsive
value"" that results in the value changing depending on the viewport size. For
example:

```tsx
// Value
<Stack gap=""condensed"" />

// Responsive value
<Stack gap={{ narrow: 'condensed', regular: 'normal', wide: 'spacious' />
```

Typically, a responsive value will support all of our named breakpoints: narrow,
regular, and wide. Authors can use a hook called `useResponsiveValue` to support
resolving the value of a prop based on the current viewport size. The
implementation of this hook uses [`matchMedia`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia)
which, unfortunately, has a downside: the value of a prop may shift when the
component is server-side rendered. If the prop is used for styles or layout, then this will lead to a layout shift
when the component hydrates and the viewport size is different than the fallback
size on the server.

As a result, we would like to offer a paved path for providing responsive props
in a way tha twill not lead to layout shift during server-side rendering.","## Decision 
To avoid layout shifts during server-side rendering (SSR) due to responsive values, we will introduce a strategy where responsive props have a deterministic fallback value used during SSR.
1. Responsive props will accept either a single value or an object mapping breakpoints (narrow, regular, wide) to values.
2. During SSR, components will render with a fallback value derived from the responsive prop. This fallback will be:
   - Explicitly provided by the author if possible, or
   - Derived by selecting the value for the ""regular"" breakpoint, or another sensible default breakpoint.
3. The `useResponsiveValue` hook will use `matchMedia` on the client to update the value matching the current viewport size.
4. The component should ensure that the server fallback and the client initial value correspond as closely as possible to prevent layout shifts on hydration.
5. Documentation and linting rules will encourage authors to provide explicit fallbacks when using responsive props to reduce the chance of mismatch.
By enforcing a clearly defined fallback value for SSR and then dynamically resolving viewport-specific values on the client, we provide a path to responsive props without causing unwanted layout shifts during hydration.","## Decision

Authors should use data attributes to bridge between responsive values in
JavaScript and the corresponding styles in CSS. Authors should avoid using
JavaScript-driven mechanisms for controlling responsive values in order to
prevent layout shift during SSR.

For example, consider a `Stack` component that has a `gap` prop. This prop can
receive a plain value or one that is a responsive value. To support this,
authors should use the following patterns:

```tsx
type GapScale = 'none' | 'condensed' | 'normal' | 'spacious'

type StackProps = React.PropsWithChildren<{
  // Responsive props should be a union of the value of the prop plus
  // `ResponsiveValue` over that value
  gap?: GapScale | ResponsiveValue<GapScale>
}>

function Stack({children, gap}: StackProps) {
  // The `getResponsiveAttributes` helper is useful for adding the corresponding
  // `data-*` attributes to the container for the compnoent.
  //
  // In this case, it will add `data-gap` and `data-gap-{breakpoint}` attributes
  // with the corresponding value set
  return <StyledStack {...getResponsiveAttributes('gap', gap)}>{children}</StyledStack>
}

const StyledStack = styled.div`
  &[data-gap='none'],
  &[data-gap-narrow='none'] {
    /* ... */
  }

  &[data-gap='condensed'],
  &[data-gap-narrow='condensed'] {
    /* ... */
  }

  /* ... */

  // @custom-media --viewportRange-regular
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    &[data-gap-regular='none'] {
      /* ... */
    }

    &[data-gap-regular='condensed'] {
      /* ... */
    }

    /* ... */
  }

  // @custom-media --viewportRange-wide
  @media (min-width: 1400px) {
    &[data-gap-wide='none'] {
      /* ... */
    }

    &[data-gap-wide='condensed'] {
      /* ... */
    }

    /* ... */
  }
`
```

By default, this approach uses the following conventions:

- Props which may have responsive values should have a value that is
  serializable, ideally as a `string` or `boolean`
- Props will be provided on the component as a data attribute, using the format:
  `data-{propName}`
- For responsive values, the breakpoint name will be appended to the data
  attribute name specified above. For example: `data-{propName}-{breakpoint}`

Data attributes will act as a bridge between JavaScript and CSS. In CSS, authors
should use these data attributes to apply styles based on the value of the
attribute per-breakpoint.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a utility named `getResponsiveAttributes` that can be used to generate
> the corresponding `data-*` attributes for the props which may have responsive
> values."
"## Context

There are times when a prop is deprecated in favor of a more accessible API or a more flexible prop that can support a wider range of values. In these cases, we want to provide a clear path for authors to migrate from the deprecated prop to the new API.

For
example:

```tsx
// old API
<ActionList>
  <ActionList.Group title=""Group title"">
    <ActionList.Item>Item 1</ActionList.Item>
    <ActionList.Item>Item 2</ActionList.Item>
  </ActionList.Group>
</ActionList>
```

```tsx
// new API
<ActionList>
  <ActionList.Group>
    <ActionList.GroupHeading as=""h2"">Group title</ActionList.GroupHeading>
    <ActionList.Item>Item 1</ActionList.Item>
    <ActionList.Item>Item 2</ActionList.Item>
  </ActionList.Group>
</ActionList>
```","## Decision
When deprecating a prop or API in favor of a new, more flexible or accessible alternative, we will provide a clear, documented migration path for authors to follow. This includes:

1. Publishing clear examples comparing the old usage and the new recommended usage side-by-side.
2. Providing warnings or deprecation notices in the codebase (e.g., console warnings) during the transition period to alert developers when the deprecated prop is used.
3. Offering helper components or utilities where needed to ease the migration (e.g., introducing components like `<ActionList.GroupHeading>` to replace deprecated props such as the `title` prop).
4. Maintaining backward compatibility during a defined transition phase to give authors time to migrate at their own pace.
5. Deprecation documentation will explain the rationale and benefits of the new API to encourage adoption.
6. Eventually, after the transition period, deprecated props will be removed in a major version release according to semantic versioning principles.

This approach ensures transparency and accessibility for authors, minimizes breaking changes, and supports a smooth evolution of the API.","## Decision

1. Add the `@deprecated` TS notice, if possible, to the corresponding type
2. Mark the prop as deprecated in the component's documentation
3. Add an eslint rule or extend an existing one to warn against using the deprecated prop
4. Update the `primer/react` eslint plugin at github/github and evaluate the impact of the deprecation
5. If the change is minimal and safe, proceed with the auto fix of the eslint rule and create PRs by codeowners
6. If the change is large, add an eslint disable to each instance of the deprecated prop at github/github and make sure they show up on the accessibility score cards so that we can track the usage of the deprecated prop
7. Enable the eslint rule afterwards in github/github so that the new instances of the deprecated prop are heavily discouraged"
"## Context

- Proxy support is required for some enterprises and organizations to start using their own self-hosted runners
- While there is not a standard convention, many applications support setting proxies via the environment variables `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `no_proxy`, such as curl, wget, perl, python, docker, git, and R
  - Some of these applications use `HTTPS_PROXY` versus `https_proxy`, but most understand or primarily support the lowercase variant","## Decision  
We will support proxy configuration for self-hosted runners by honoring the widely adopted environment variables `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy`.  
Specifically:  
- Our software will recognize and use the lowercase variants `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` for configuring outbound proxy behavior.  
- We will not prioritize uppercase variants like `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY`, since most widely used applications primarily rely on the lowercase forms. However, we may document the uppercase variants as alternative environment variables some systems use.  
- This approach aligns with broad industry conventions in tools such as curl, wget, git, and docker, ensuring familiar and straightforward user configuration.  
- Supporting proxy settings via environment variables reduces configuration complexity and integrates well with standard deployment environments.","## Decision

We will update the Runner to use the conventional environment variables for proxies: `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` if they are set.
These are described in detail below:
- `https_proxy` a proxy URL for all https traffic. It may contain basic authentication credentials. For example:
  - http://proxy.com
  - http://127.0.0.1:8080
  - http://user:password@proxy.com
- `http_proxy` a proxy URL for all http traffic. It may contain basic authentication credentials. For example:
  - http://proxy.com
  - http://127.0.0.1:8080
  - http://user:password@proxy.com
- `no_proxy` a comma-separated list of hosts that should not use the proxy. An optional port may be specified. For example:
  - `google.com`
  - `yahoo.com:443`
  - `google.com,bing.com`

We won't use `http_proxy` for https traffic when `https_proxy` is not set, this behavior lines up with any libcurl based tools (curl, git) and wget.
Otherwise, action authors and workflow users need to adjust to differences between the runner proxy convention, and tools used by their actions and scripts.  

Example:  
  Customer sets `http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888` and configures the runner against `https://github.com/owner/repo`, with the `https_proxy` -> `http_proxy` fallback, the runner will connect to the server without any problem. However, if a user runs `git push` to `https://github.com/owner/repo`, `git` won't use the proxy since it requires `https_proxy` to be set for any https traffic.

> `golang`, `node.js`, and other dev tools from the Linux community use `http_proxy` for both http and https traffic based on my research.

A majority of our users are using Linux where these variables are commonly required to be set by various programs. By reading these values, we simplify the process for self-hosted runners to set up a proxy and expose it in a way users are already familiar with.

A password provided for a proxy will be masked in the logs.

We will support the lowercase and uppercase variants, with lowercase taking priority if both are set."
"## Context

Command echoing as a default behavior tends to clutter the user logs, so we want to swap to a system where users have to opt in to see this information.

Command outputs will still be echoed in the case there are any errors processing such commands. This is so the end user can have more context on why the command failed and help with troubleshooting.

Echo output in the user logs can be explicitly controlled by the new commands `::echo::on` and `::echo::off`. By default, echoing is enabled if `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret is enabled, otherwise echoing is disabled.","## Decision  
We will change the default behavior of command echoing in user logs to be opt-in rather than opt-out. This means:  
- By default, command echoing is disabled to reduce log clutter.  
- Users can enable command echoing explicitly by running the new commands `::echo::on` to turn echoing on, and `::echo::off` to turn it off as needed.  
- Command outputs will always be echoed when an error occurs during command processing, regardless of the echo setting, to aid in troubleshooting.  
- As an additional default override, if the secret `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` is enabled, echoing will be enabled by default.  
This approach balances visibility and log noise, allowing users to control echoing while preserving helpful output in error cases.","## Decision
- The only commands that currently echo output are
  - `remove-matcher`
  - `add-matcher`
  - `add-path`
- These will no longer echo the command, if processed successfully
- All commands echo the input when any of these conditions is fulfilled:
  1. When such commands fail with an error
  2. When `::echo::on` is set
  3. When the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` is set, and echoing hasn't been explicitly disabled with `::echo::off`
- There are a few commands that won't be echoed, even when echo is enabled. These are (as of 2019/11/04):
   - `add-mask`
   - `debug`
   - `warning`
   - `error`
- The three commands above will not echo, either because echoing the command would leak secrets (e.g. `add-mask`), or it would not add any additional troubleshooting information to the logs (e.g. `debug`). It's expected that future commands would follow these ""echo-suppressing"" guidelines as well. Echo-suppressed commands are still free to output other information to the logs, as deemed fit."
"## Context

- Provide a mechanism in the runner to include extra information in `Set up job` step's log.
  Ex: Include OS/Software info from Hosted image.","## Decision
We will enhance the runner's `Set up job` step to include additional diagnostic information in its log output. Specifically, this will incorporate OS and software environment details from the hosted image used for the job execution.

The approach is:
- Modify the setup process to collect relevant environment metadata such as OS version, installed software versions, and key runtime characteristics.
- Integrate these details into the existing log output for the `Set up job` step, ensuring clear formatting for readability.
- Maintain transparency by making this information easily accessible to users and maintainers to help diagnose environment-related issues.
- Ensure that logging this extra metadata does not adversely impact setup time or confidentiality of sensitive information.

This decision improves troubleshooting capabilities by making environment details explicit in the job setup logging without requiring additional manual steps.","## Decision

The runner will look for a file `.setup_info` under the runner's root directory, The file can be a JSON with a simple schema.
```json
[
  {
    ""group"": ""OS Detail"",
    ""detail"": ""........""
  },
  {
    ""group"": ""Software Detail"",
    ""detail"": ""........""
  }
]
```
The runner will use `::group` and `::endgroup` to fold all detail info into an expandable group.

Both [virtual-environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) and self-hosted runners can use this mechanism to add extra logging info to the `Set up job` step's log."

This ADR proposes adding `steps.<id>.outcome` and `steps.<id>.conclusion` to the steps context.

This allows downstream a step to run based on whether a previous step succeeded or failed.

Reminder, currently the steps contains `steps.<id>.outputs`.","## Decision 
We will extend the steps context by adding two new fields per step: `steps.<id>.outcome` and `steps.<id>.conclusion`.
- `steps.<id>.outcome` will explicitly indicate whether a step succeeded or failed, providing a clear and standardized way to represent the result of a step.
- `steps.<id>.conclusion` will provide additional semantic information about the step's completion status, possibly including outcomes such as success, failure, cancelled, or skipped.
This enhancement will enable downstream steps to conditionally execute based on the success or failure of prior steps, improving control flow and decision-making within the step execution process.
The existing `steps.<id>.outputs` field will remain unchanged and continues to represent the data outputs of each step.","## Decision

For steps that have completed, populate `steps.<id>.outcome` and `steps.<id>.conclusion` with one of the following values:

- `success`
- `failure`
- `cancelled`
- `skipped`

When a continue-on-error step fails, the outcome will be `failure` even though the final conclusion is `success`."

Since configuring self-hosted runners is commonly automated via scripts, the labels need to be able to be created during configuration.  The runner currently registers the built-in labels (os, arch) during registration but does not accept labels via command line args to extend the set registered.

See Issue: https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/262

This is another version of [ADR275](https://github.com/actions/runner/pull/275)","## Decision  
We will extend the self-hosted runner registration process to accept additional labels via command line arguments. This will allow users to specify custom labels during the automated configuration of runners, ensuring that the runner registers not only the built-in labels (os, arch) but also any user-defined labels at registration time.  
This enhancement improves flexibility and automation capabilities, aligning with user needs expressed in issue https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/262 and builds upon the work and discussions in ADR275.  
The implementation will:  
- Add support for one or more label arguments in the runner registration command.  
- Merge user-provided labels with the default built-in labels during registration.  
- Validate and document the usage for users configuring runners via scripts.  
This decision maintains backward compatibility by retaining the existing built-in labels registration behavior while adding extensibility via command line parameters.","## Decision

This ADR proposes that we add a `--labels` option to the `config`, which could be used to add custom additional labels to the configured runner.

For example, to add a single additional label the operator could run:
```bash
./config.sh --labels mylabel
```
> Note: the current runner command line parsing and envvar override algorithm only support a single argument (key).

This would add the label `mylabel` to the runner, and enable users to select the runner in their workflow using this label:
```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, mylabel]
```

To add multiple labels the operator could run:
```bash
./config.sh --labels mylabel,anotherlabel
```
> Note: the current runner command line parsing and envvar override algorithm only supports a single argument (key).

This would add the label `mylabel` and `anotherlabel` to the runner, and enable users to select the runner in their workflow using this label:
```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, mylabel, anotherlabel]
```

It would not be possible to remove labels from an existing runner using `config.sh`, instead labels would have to be removed using the GitHub UI.

The labels argument will split on commas, trim and discard empty strings.  That effectively means don't use commas in unattended config label names.  Alternatively, we could choose to escape commas but it's a nice to have."

SS?? fundamentally relies on a third-party provider service to authenticate requests (e.g. OAuth2
via Google). The provider may experience transient faults for any number of reasons - perhaps the
provider is experiencing a transient outage, or our traffic has been temporarily rate limited. We
wanted to build SS?? to anticipate and handle the presence of faults during communication with
authentication providers, no matter the underlying cause.","## Decision  
We will implement a robust fault tolerance strategy when communicating with third-party authentication providers. This strategy will include:  
1. Automatic retrying of requests that fail due to transient errors, using an exponential backoff mechanism to avoid overwhelming the provider.  
2. Circuit breaker logic to temporarily stop sending requests to the provider when a threshold of failures is detected, allowing the system to recover.  
3. Clear logging and monitoring of authentication request failures to enable rapid diagnosis and response.  
4. Graceful degradation behavior in the application to handle authentication unavailability, such as displaying informative error messages or limited functionality mode.  
5. Encapsulation of all provider communications within a fault-handling abstraction layer to centralize and standardize error handling.  
This approach will help maintain reliable operation of SS?? even when external authentication providers experience transient faults.","## Decision
We implemented a generic `circuit.Breaker` type, which implements the ""Circuit Breaker"" design
pattern made popular by Michael T. Nygard's book, [""Release It!""](
https://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it). All requests to the provider service are issued through
a stateful `circuit.Breaker` instance, which tracks the frequency of request failures. When the
`Breaker` sees that enough requests are failing, it temporarily suspends all outgoing traffic to the
provider (i.e. ""enters `Open` state). After some time, the `Breaker` transitions to a `HalfOpen`
state, in which a limited number of outbound requests are allowed. If failures persist, then the
`Breaker` will once again suspend outbound traffic, re-enter `Open` state, and typically will wait
for a longer interval of time before trying again. If instead the `Breaker` observes that requests
are consistently succeeding, then it will resume all outbound traffic (i.e. enter `Closed` state).

The SS?? [`docs`](/docs/) directory contains a [Circuit Breaker](
/docs/architecture/circuit-breaker.md) document with more details. The implementation can be found
in [`breaker.go`](/internal/auth/circuit/breaker.go)"

We make a lot of decisions during the life of a project and
documenting those decisions would help new team members and outside
contributors follow our thinking. It also opens up an opportunity for
constructive criticism around those decisions which will result
in better decision making.

We want to develop a product in the open. Opening up our decision making process for outside contributors is an important part in providing the opportunity to take ownership and impact the project in non-trivial ways.

Recording decisions will also be a useful form of documentation in general as it does not get out of date. All that's documented is that a decision has been made at a certain point in time.","## Decision 
We will adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document all significant decisions made throughout the project lifecycle. These ADRs will be publicly accessible to ensure transparency and to invite constructive feedback from the community, including outside contributors.
The process will be:
1. Document each decision with a clear context, the options considered, the decision reached, and its implications.
2. Make ADRs available in the project repository or a public platform to ensure visibility.
3. Encourage community and team members to review and contribute to ADRs prior to final acceptance.
4. Use ADRs as a living documentation resource that remains relevant and accurate over time as they reflect decisions made rather than implementation details.

Extensions are defined by an EDN file accessed from decentralized storage. An URI schema allows to identify those files.","## Decision
We will use a standardized EDN file format to define Arachne extensions, enabling clear, consistent representation of extension metadata and configuration.
These extension definition files will be stored in decentralized storage systems to promote resilience and distribution.
A custom URI schema will be established to uniquely identify and locate these extension EDN files within the decentralized storage network.
The URI schema will support reliable resolution and retrieval of extension definitions, facilitating dynamic discovery and loading of extensions.

We want to launch our beta in Q2. This requires us to keep a tight scope and stay on the critical path.

Group chat is not as vital as 1-1 chat for the chat experience. It is also
likely not as useful for an MVP as public chat is, since this gives people a
chance to talk to strangers and it is open by default.

Whether group chats are in scope or not has been a recurring discussing and a
lot of effort has been wasted related to this.

There are currently a lot of outstanding regressions related to group chat: https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/labels/group-chat Additionally, since group chats are private the encryption and security of those are generally harder than 1-1 and public chat.","## Decision 
To meet the Q2 beta launch deadline and maintain focus on critical path features, we will exclude group chat functionality from the MVP. Our initial chat experience will support:
- 1-1 private chats, prioritized for security and usability.
- Public chats, enabling open interactions with strangers, which aligns better with MVP goals.
Group chat, due to its complexity, outstanding regressions, and increased encryption/security challenges, will be deferred to a post-beta release.
This decision reduces scope, helps avoid further wasted effort on unstable group chat features, and allows the team to focus on delivering a stable and secure core chat experience for the beta release.","## Decision

Disable group chat for beta and don't work on bugs related to it until after. See https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/3995

time to fix group chats properly."

Currently peers for messaging are hardcoded in the app. This means we can't
easily scale, as some of these nodes might fill up when we have more than N
active users.

Discovery v5 protocol (https://ideas.status.im/ideas/092-disc-v5-research,
https://github.com/fjl/p2p-drafts/blob/master/discv5-eip.md) allow us to
discover new peers from the app and scale server peers in our cluster
independently. This is vital for high availability/reliability and security.","## Decision 
We will integrate the Discovery v5 protocol into the messaging application to replace the current hardcoded peer list.
This shift will enable dynamic discovery of peers, facilitating better scalability and load distribution across the node cluster.
Key points include:
- Implement the Discovery v5 protocol following the established specifications to allow the app to discover peers at runtime.
- Design the system to allow independent scaling of server peers, addressing bottlenecks caused by static peer lists.
- Ensure that integration maintains or improves high availability, reliability, and security by continuously discovering and validating active peers.
- Update the application configuration and architecture to support dynamic peer management, removing all hardcoded peer references in favor of the dynamic discovery mechanism.
- Provide monitoring and logging to observe peer discovery performance and troubleshoot connectivity issues.
By adopting Discovery v5, the architecture will be more resilient and scalable, better supporting growth in active users.","## Decision

- Use and enable Discovery v5 for all networks
- Do this before beta is released

This means we have capacity to achieve 5000+ DAU / 500 concurrent connection. It
seems unlikely we can do so with reliable messaging in the current setup.

- Uncertainty in introducing a new protocol leading to possible delays
- Possible increase in CPU/Network (we can disable protocol once peers are found though)"

- Implementing the updated key derivation logic that matches the scheme used by other popular wallet applications.
- Ensuring that users can import wallets generated in other applications into Status without loss of funds or access.
- Verifying backward compatibility where feasible to avoid disrupting existing wallets.

"## Context

On the path to releasing a usable beta we've faced a variety of performance
issues:

- https://github.com/status-im/ideas/issues/55
- https://ideas.status.im/ideas/071-low-traffic
- https://ideas.status.im/ideas/076-smooth-ui
- https://ideas.status.im/ideas/083-energy-efficient

Some of these performance issues are related to the use of LES, especially on
Mainnet. Examples of problems include: slow/hot sync, disk filling up, bandwidth
usage, etc. This can partly be remedied by the use of CHT to speed up sync
(https://github.com/status-im/status-go/wiki/Updating-CHT-BloomTrie).

In order to simplify the problem, we decided earlier this year to not spend too
much time looking into performance improvements related to LES, instead focusing
our efforts on improving the performance on Whisper and in client-side code.

This also means we don't have a full picture of to what extent LES is a
performance bottleneck for the Status app. It is possible proper use of CHT,
slowing sync down, vary load depending on if you are on WiFi or not, etc, can
solve these problems. However, the consensus right now is that ULC is the more
promising route to take.

However, since ULC isn't ready yet, this means we are relying on Infura. This
is a bad idea from a decentralization and security point of view. This can be
partly remedied by allowing the user to run an upstream node. It is still a bad
trust model, relying on third-party Ethereum nodes, and we want to get away
from this as soon as possible.

With ULC it is possible to connect to more than one node, which increases
decentralization and security.","## Decision 
In the near term, we will continue to rely on Infura as the primary upstream Ethereum node service for the Status app to ensure sufficient performance and reliability.
To mitigate centralization and security concerns, we will implement support allowing users to configure and run their own upstream Ethereum nodes if they wish.
We will avoid dedicating significant development effort to optimizing LES performance currently, acknowledging that LES may present performance bottlenecks but choosing to prioritize improvements to Whisper and client-side code instead.
We recognize that CHT and other LES optimizations, as well as adaptive sync behavior (e.g., varying load based on network conditions), could address some issues but will treat these as secondary measures.
Our long-term goal remains transitioning to ULC (Unified Light Client) once it becomes production-ready, as it offers improved decentralization, the ability to connect to multiple nodes simultaneously, and better overall performance.
This transition will enable us to move away from reliance on Infura and LES, improving decentralization and security in the Status app Ethereum connectivity.","## Decision

1. Rely on upstream nodes for beta. For the closed beta scheduled to be releases
Q2 we will provide two ways of accessing the Ethereum network:

- Upstream RPC with Infura (default)
- Custom upstream node (https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/3994)

From a decentralization point of view we need the latter before we can release
the beta.

2. ULC MVP. Additionally, as soon as beta is released, assess and start to
   introduce ULC as an experimental non-default mode in the app.
   
By doing this we also support the network, since it is still a very new
protocol. ULC requires trusted peers to operate, and right now trust is
established by config (list of trusted peers).

Initially we could hardcode these nodes, with option to add your own. Later on
we can have some form of distributed directory with a rating system. This also
likely requires merging ULC upstream, so we aren't the only ones running trusted
nodes.

3. LES track (optional). If we still have resources and there's interest,
optionally run a parallel track to clean up LES usage (update CHT, cluster) and
understand exact performance impact and viablity of running LES on
resource-constrained devices.

These three decisions balances the following trade-offs:

- get a usable beta released as soon as possible
- provide users with options to get minimal amount of decentralization
- pave the way for trustless usage by default (ULC/LES node)"
"## Context

We have some data that we don't want to appear in the logs (user passwords are
a good example). Currently, they are passed around as strings, that could be
printed out by mistake in a log entry (see https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/4053)","## Decision 
We will introduce a data wrapper type, called `SensitiveString`, to encapsulate any string containing sensitive information such as passwords. This wrapper will override the default printing and logging behavior to avoid exposing the underlying value. Specifically:
- When a `SensitiveString` is logged or printed, it will display a placeholder such as ""***"" or ""[REDACTED]"" instead of the actual content.
- Code handling sensitive data will be required to unwrap the `SensitiveString` explicitly to access the raw string value.
- Functions that handle logging or string serialization will detect `SensitiveString` and mask their output appropriately.
This approach helps to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information in logs while allowing the underlying data to be used securely within the application as needed.","## Decision

To minimize the risk of leaking passwords through logs, we should not pass
passwords as strings in our codebase. We introduced a new type `MaskedData` in
`status-im.utils.security`.
update (16-Dec-2022) `status-im.utils.security` is now moved over to `utils.security.core` 

We use `(security/mask-data <data to hide>` to wrap sensitive data into this
type and then use `(security/unmask <masked-data>)` to get the plaintext back.

It is important to keep that sensitive data masked as much as possible, until
you need the plaintext to pass to the extenral APIs.

Example:
```clojure
(println (security/mask-data ""my-plaintext-password"")) ;; Outputs ""******""
(println (security/unmask (security/mask-data ""my-plaintext-password""))) ;; Outputs ""my-plaintext-password""
```"
"## Context

Originally, we supported 3rd party status extensions in form of javascript jailed execution environment (eq Jail) + small js library exposing chat commands API to js code.

While neat in theory, it has some serious downsides:

- Design of the API was quite poor, preferring mutable semantics over stateless API leveraging strength of the host application (cljs/re-frame).
  As a result of that, more dynamic/state requiring things (like the live tx detail in `/send` command messages) were very hard to do,
  so instead of ""eating our own dogfood"", we decided to side-step the API and implement such things as hard-coded logic in the app, while partly
  retaining the js code for ""easier"" things (like parameter declaration).
  Needles to say, such efforts produced code of very poor quality, riddling our app with hard-coded ""magic"" everywhere in the codebase, completely
  defeating the point of ""dogfooding"" while still requiring more effort and being much more error prone (no way to unit test jail logic) because 
  of the need to asynchronously communicate with jail for leftover logic in command messages (the parts not hardcoded in app).
  
- We were in a state where there was not even one command defined completely in jail, with all of them requiring custom hardcoded logic in app to
  actually work.
  Due to numerous changes and rush to get things working, half of the API was obsolete and was not working/working differently then described in
  the API documentation.
  
- We are quite tight stretched regarding performance and the Jail didn't particularly help with that - whenever some command message was defined in
  Jail, it required constant RN Bridge ""ping-pong"" whenever sending the message or receiving the message, eating more resources + breaking otherwise
  quite simple logic into harder to reason asynchronous call chains (execute method defined in Jail, wait for the result, execute next method in Jail...).
  
- Till now, there was no real interest in 3rd party bots anyway - the only ""real"" DAPPs submitted to status were ""normal"" DAPPs utilising just the `web3.js`
  API and built on top of regular web technologies, so they could be ran in any Ethereum client like Metamask or Mist, besides Status.
  
- There is a very promising new concept of extensions (project pluto), which will enable to extend status with much nicer and declarative extension
  definitions.
  Such extensions will not be able to only hook-in into the command messages logic, but also other application (host) hooks, like wallet assets/collectibles,
  chat contacts, etc.","## Decision
We will deprecate and remove the existing 3rd party status extensions system based on the JavaScript jailed execution environment (Jail) and its associated chat commands API.

Instead, we will adopt the new project Pluto extensions framework, which provides a more declarative, composable, and performant model for extending Status.

Key points of this decision:
- The Jail-based system demonstrated significant shortcomings, including poor API design favoring mutable semantics, requiring pervasive hard-coded logic in the app, leading to low-quality and hard-to-maintain code.
- Performance overhead from frequent React Native bridge calls caused inefficiencies and complex asynchronous flows that were difficult to reason about.
- There has been limited interest or adoption of the jail-based 3rd party bots, further reducing its value.
- The new extensions framework under Pluto offers a richer set of integration points beyond command messages, including wallet assets, collectibles, chat contacts, and more, enabling more powerful and extensible applications.
- Transitioning to Pluto extensions aligns with our goals of better abstraction, improved developer experience, and more maintainable, testable extension code.

The implementation roadmap will include:
1. Phasing out existing jail-based extensions and removing the legacy code.
2. Providing migration guidance and tooling where possible to transition existing functionality to the new extensions framework.
3. Encouraging developers to adopt new declarative extension definitions under the Pluto project.
4. Ensuring the new extensions system supports necessary hooks and integration points to meet user and developer needs.

This change will simplify the extension ecosystem, improve performance, and enhance developer productivity and code quality within Status.","## Decision

In the light of points above, we decided to remove Jail and `Status.js` API from the application and re-work command messages in set of nicely
encapsulated app level protocols, so command related logic will be defined in one place, commands will be able to leverage strength of our platform
and development of any new functionality related to them will be much faster and more pleasant. 
We will address the 3rd party code issue separately by extensions."

The whitepaper describes Tribute to Talk (TtT) as an economics-based anti-spam filter for receiving messages and ""cold"" contact requests from user. Stakeholders would stake a minimum amount of SNT that another Status stakeholder must deposit in order to contact him directly.

We will implement Tribute to Talk (TtT) as an economics-based anti-spam mechanism where senders must stake a minimum amount of SNT tokens to initiate direct contact with another Status stakeholder.
Key aspects of the implementation:
- The sender stakes the required minimum SNT deposit to contact a recipient.
- The deposit is held in escrow and only forfeited to the recipient if the recipient replies to the message.
- If the recipient does not reply, the staked deposit is returned to the sender.
- This mechanism encourages meaningful communication and disincentivizes spam by introducing an economic cost for unsolicited messages.
This approach aligns with the whitepaper's proposal and provides a transparent, fair system for managing inbound contact requests.","## Decision

Considering:
- the absence of efficient ways to perform anonymous transactions (zk-snarks could be used in the future for that)
- the impossibility to prove that a recipient has made an actual reply and not some kind of automated reply (captcha solution was proposed, but wouldn't be practical until we can use a solution such as swarm feeds that allow users to make free updates to their captcha without on-chain transactions)
- the limited time to develop the feature

We opted for a solution that:
- doesn't establish a direct correlation between the tribute payment and an on-chain transaction, so it
- uses regular transactions for tributes payment, giving users plausible deniability about the nature of the payment
- doesn't store tribute information on-chain"

The decision is to create an additional role within the mobile development team for each section. The individuals selected for these roles will have the following responsibilities:

- Ensure GitHub issues are created for new features/designs of the section.
- Ensure issues are adequately described and linked as best as possible.
- Ensure issues have a grooming session where other developers can provide their feedback before working on the set of issues.
- Ensure all relevant parties are invited, such as designers, QA, Product Owner, leads, etc., as needed (including the designer who created the feature).
- Ensure there is consensus among the developers working on the section about the decided strategy approach. Ideally, this consensus should be documented.
- Ensure UI quality by organizing designer reviews and guaranteeing pixel perfection.
- Ensure overall implementation is satisfactory based on the predefined requirements.
- Ensure alignment between desktop, web, and mobile versions for the respective section in collaboration with the mobile developers and design team.
- Act as a point of contact for the design team with respect to the section.
- Ensure that someone goes through the designs once they are created with the respective designer.
- Assist the design team with technical feasibility analysis and address any product concerns.
- Facilitate the growth of the next team member into the role.

The people identified for each sections are as follow:

- Messaging @flexsurfer, followed by @alwx
- Syncing & Onboarding @siddarthkay
- Communities @ilmotta, followed by @ajayesivan
- Activity Center & Shell @J-Son89, followed by @Parveshdhull
- Wallet (once the vertical team is created) @J-Son89, followed by @briansztamfater

This will be a rotating post, every 4 months it will go to the next in line.

The wallet team might have longer times for rotation, as stability might be more important. That's still to be decided.

During the development of a new Sylius API (based on API Platform) for Product Options, we had to decide how we should handle
Product Option's values collection, to make it efficient and easy to use.","## Decision
For managing the Product Option's values collection in the new Sylius API based on API Platform, we will adopt a design that emphasizes both efficiency and ease of use:
1. The values collection will be modeled as a separate resource with its own dedicated API endpoints, allowing for independent retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion.
2. To optimize performance, we will implement pagination and filtering capabilities on the collection endpoints, ensuring that clients can request only the data they need.
3. Relations between Product Options and their values will be represented using standardized Hydra or JSON-LD mechanisms to maintain API Platform compatibility and clarity.
4. Where appropriate, embedding of values within Product Option responses will be supported for common use cases to reduce the number of client requests.
5. This approach balances normalization with practical usability, ensuring that the API remains performant, scalable, and user-friendly.","## Decision and reasoning

Product option values should always be provided with their IRIs. They can exist outside of the `ProductOption` resource 
(e.g. be [related with](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Component/Product/Model/ProductVariant.php#L44) `ProductVariant`).
Moreover, values embedded together with their translations in the `ProductOption` that already has its translations would
result in a massive and unmanageable response."
"## Context and Problem Statement

A big chunk of resources available in Sylius have some part locale aware. Product descriptions, names of payment or shipping methods
should be translated to the customer to provide the best user experience. Right now most of the resources are returned with 
all available translations in the store and proper localization of content is left to the frontend developers. What is more,
this solution is not consistent, as some endpoints already embeds some part of translatables in them. We should provide clear,
easy to use and consistent way of handling customer locales.","## Decision  
We will introduce a centralized localization mechanism within Sylius backend that ensures all locale-aware resource data are filtered and delivered according to the customer's locale.
Key aspects of the decision include:
- Back-end endpoints will return only the localized content relevant to the requested or detected customer locale instead of all available translations.
- All translatable fields such as product descriptions, payment method names, and shipping method names will be consistently handled through this mechanism.
- The API contracts will be updated to reflect that localized content is already resolved, relieving frontend developers from managing localization logic.
- Configuration will be added for specifying default locale behavior and fallback locales in case of missing translations.
- This approach will improve UX by delivering precisely localized content with reduced payload and ensure consistency across all localized resources.","## Decision Outcome

The first approach should be used in admin section of API, while the third one should be used in shop section. This way, we
will receive best of both worlds with the minimal effort. It is worth mentioning that Sylius have two distinguish entry points
to API - admin and shop. They are concerned about different things and resolves different problems. Unified view of a product
in the shop will make it easy and straightforward to build product pages. At the same time all translation approach should be used in
admin to provide full control over ""translation"" resource - as we should treat them. Therefore, every resource translation
should be linked to the main resource through IRI. Each of these translation resource may be a subject of all CRUD operations
accessible throughout HTTP Verbs."

Decisions that affect the development of Terraform Controller that are not
captured via a proposal need to be captured in some way. We need a method that
is lightweight and easy to discover the decision that have been made. The record
of decisions will help future contributors to the project to understand why
something has been implemented or is done a certain way.","## Decision 
We will adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document all significant decisions related to the development of Terraform Controller that are not captured through formal proposals.
Each ADR will be a concise markdown document stored in the project repository, following a consistent template including:
- Title and Status (proposed, accepted, rejected, superseded)
- Context explaining the background and the problem statement
- The Decision itself, detailing the solution chosen
- Consequences including trade-offs, implications, or alternative options considered
This approach ensures decisions are documented in a lightweight, discoverable, and transparent manner, facilitating easier onboarding and future reference for contributors.
All developers will be expected to create or update ADRs for notable architectural or design changes.","## Decision

The project will use [Architectural Decision Records
(ADR)](https://adr.github.io/) to record decisions that are made outside of a
proposal.

A [template](./0000-template.md) has been created based on prior work:

To detect pull request changes, we can use webhooks or polling using GitHub's
API.","## Decision
To detect pull request changes, we will use GitHub webhooks rather than polling the GitHub API. Webhooks offer a more efficient and real-time approach, reducing unnecessary API calls and ensuring timely updates on pull request events. This aligns with best practices for event-driven integrations and minimizes resource consumption on both client and server sides. If webhook setup is not feasible due to environment constraints, polling can be considered as a fallback with appropriate back-off strategies to manage API rate limits.","## Decision

We decided to start with polling for security reasons. Using webhooks would require users to
open an ingress to the cluster. Because of this requirement, we think security conscious folks may refuse to roll this out on production clusters especially in an
air-gapped environment. This does not mean that we will never consider using webhooks for this, but that initially, polling is what we have chosen to implement.

The Branch-Based Planner has two components:

1. Polling Server: Detect Pull Request changes and manage Teraform resource
   state.
2. Informer: Make a comment when new plan output is available."
"## Context

Like [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/), the tf-controller API has a handful
of places where it accepts cross-namespace references.

 - `Terraform.spec.sourceRef` -- refers to the Flux source object with
   the Terraform program
 - `Terraform.spec.dependsOn[]` -- refers to other objects that must
   be ready before this object can be run
 - `.data.resources[]` -- in the config struct used by the branch
   planner

In general in Kubernetes, references to objects in other namespaces
are frowned upon, because

 - they break namespace isolation assurances; and,
 - they encourage the proliferation of permissions.

Both of these effects make a system less secure.

However: removing cross-namespace refs entirely would break some
installations in a way that would be difficult to fix, because Flux
deployments often rely on defining sources away from objects that use
them.","## Decision 
The tf-controller API will continue to allow a limited set of cross-namespace references, specifically in the fields `Terraform.spec.sourceRef`, `Terraform.spec.dependsOn[]`, and `.data.resources[]`.
This decision balances the need for namespace isolation with practical deployment considerations:
- Cross-namespace references will be kept minimal and explicitly documented, avoiding unnecessary or implicit cross-namespace dependencies.
- Users should be encouraged to minimize cross-namespace references where possible, and documentation will highlight the security implications.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) policies should be carefully crafted to limit permissions needed for valid cross-namespace references, preserving security boundaries.
- Future enhancements may explore alternative approaches to reduce or eliminate cross-namespace references, but backward compatibility and ease of migration remain priorities.
By maintaining controlled cross-namespace references, the tf-controller API preserves flexibility while acknowledging Kubernetes security best practices.","## Decision

Deny cross-namespace references by default, but allow them to be
enabled with a flag.

So that the default value means the right thing, the flag name must be
`enable-cross-namespace-refs`, and the default `false`. To avoid
confusion when people try to use the Flux version of this flag
`--disable-cross-namespace-refs`, it should be supported too, but only
respected if supplied."
"## Context

The TF-Controller currently faces challenges related to the deletion of Terraform resources.
These problems span across three categories:

1. Single object deletion,
2. Resources with dependencies deletion, and
3. Namespace deletion.

These problems must be fixed in the above order as (2) and (3) require single object deletion to be resolved first.

Deleting a single TF object can sometimes be obstructed because it's tied to other resources like Source objects, Secrets, and ConfigMaps. If we try to remove it without deleting these resources, the TF object gets stuck in an inconsistent state, making it harder for users to manage their infrastructure smoothly.
Therefore, the TF-Controller is being enhanced to address this problem more efficiently, using the contents of generated Workspace BLOBs. Each BLOB contains all necessary information from the associated Source, Secrets, and ConfigMaps to ensure that TF-Controller finalization procedures can delete objects correctly.

Currently, the TF-Controller downloads a Source BLOB and pushes it to a tf-runner. The tf-runner processes this BLOB to create a Workspace file system. It generates a backend configuration file, variable files, and other necessary files for the Workspace file system, using data from associated Secrets and ConfigMaps. This newly created Workspace file system is then compressed, sent back to the TF-Controller, and stored as a Workspace BLOB in the controller's storage.
A caching mechanism for these BLOBs is essential to fixing the single TF object deletion process.","## Decision 
We will implement a caching mechanism in the TF-Controller to store and manage Workspace BLOBs effectively. This cache will hold the Workspace BLOBs generated from Sources, Secrets, and ConfigMaps, enabling the controller to quickly access all necessary information to finalize and delete single Terraform objects reliably.
The workflow will be:
1. When a Source BLOB is downloaded and processed by the tf-runner to generate the Workspace file system, the resulting Workspace BLOB will be cached within the TF-Controller.
2. The cache will maintain immutability and consistency of BLOBs to prevent stale or inconsistent data during deletion operations.
3. Deletion finalizers in the TF-Controller will use the cached Workspace BLOBs to identify and delete all dependent resources (Source objects, Secrets, ConfigMaps) tied to the Terraform resource, ensuring clean removal without leaving resources in inconsistent states.
4. This caching solution will be designed to support the subsequent implementation of dependent resource deletion and namespace deletion, forming a stable foundation for the broader cleanup improvements.
By adopting this approach, the TF-Controller will improve robustness and reliability in managing the lifecycle of Terraform resources, starting with resolving the single object deletion challenge.","## Decision

1. **BLOB Creation and Storage**
   * A gRPC function named `CreateWorkspaceBlob` will be invoked by the TF-Controller 
     to tell tf-runner to compress the Workspace file system into a tar.gz BLOB, which is then retrieved back to the controller.
   * The caching mechanism will be executed right before the Terraform Initialization step, ensuring that the latest and most relevant data is used.
   * Each Workspace Blob will be cached on the TF-Controller's local disk, using the UUID of the Terraform object as the filename,`${uuid}.tar.gz`.
   * To reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the cache entries, and cache collisions, the cache file will be deleted after the finalization process is complete.
2. **Persistence** 
   * [The persistence mechanism used by the Source Controller](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/configuration/vertical-scaling/#persistent-storage-for-flux-internal-artifacts) will be adopted for the TF-Controller's persistence volume.
3. **BLOB Encryption**
   * The encryption and decryption of the BLOBs will be tasked to the runner, with the controller solely responsible for storing encrypted BLOBs.
   * Each namespace will require a service account, preferably named ""tf-runner"".
   * The token of this service account, which is natively supported by Kubernetes, will serve as the most appropriate encryption key because it's stored in a Secret, access to which can be controlled by RBAC. Storing it in a Secret also allows the key to be rotated.
4. **Security Measures (Based on STRIDE Analysis)**
   * **Spoofing:** Implement Kubernetes RBAC for access restrictions and use mutual authentication for gRPC communications.
   * **Tampering:** Use checksums for integrity verification and 0600 permissions to write-protect local disk storage.
   * **Repudiation:** Ensure strong logging and auditing mechanisms for tracking activities.
   * **Information Disclosure:** Utilize robust encryption algorithms, rotate encryption keys periodically, and secure service account tokens.
   * **Denial of Service:** Monitor storage space and automate cleanup processes.
   * **Elevation of Privilege:** Minimize permissions associated with service account tokens.
5. **First MVP & Future Planning**
   * For the initial MVP, the default pod local volume will be used.
   * Since a controller restart will erase the BLOB cache, consideration for using persistent volumes should be made for subsequent versions."

In previous releases of Zarf, the creation of the initialization package at the core of many of our E2E tests required repository secrets to login to registry1. Since this is an open-source project, anyone could submit a change to one of our GitHub workflows that could steal our secrets. In order to protect our secrets from any bad-actors we used [peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch@v2](https://github.com/peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch) so that only a maintainer would have the ability to run the E2E tests when a PR is submitted for review.

In the current version of Zarf (v0.15) images from registry1 are no longer needed to create the zarf-init-{{arch}}.tar.zst. This means, given our current span of E2E tests, we no longer need to use repository secrets when running tests. This gives us the ability to reassess the way we do our E2E testing.

When considering how to handle the tests, some of the important additions we were considering were:
  1. Ability to test against different kubernetes distributions
  2. Ability to test against different linux distributions
  3. Ability to run (at least some of) the E2E tests locally without relying on an ec2 instance - for quicker feedback loops when developing new features","## Decision 
Given that we no longer need repository secrets for E2E tests in Zarf v0.15 and considering the desired test capabilities, we will redesign the E2E testing framework to:

1. Remove the existing restrictions requiring maintainer approval to run tests due to secret usage, enabling automated test runs on PR submissions.
2. Implement configurable testing matrices supporting multiple Kubernetes distributions and Linux distributions, enabling broad environment coverage.
3. Introduce support for running a subset of E2E tests locally without requiring EC2 instances or cloud infrastructure, thereby improving developer feedback speed.
4. Maintain flexibility in running full test suites in cloud environments for comprehensive integration testing.
5. Ensure that the new testing approach is secure, maintainable, and transparent, leveraging existing infrastructure where possible but removing secret-dependent bottlenecks.

This approach balances the improved security posture with enhanced test coverage, developer productivity, and operational simplicity.","## Decision

The previous E2E test code was not extensible enough to be reused to test Zarf against different kubernetes distributions. The test suite was refactored so that we could write a setup and teardown function for each kubernetes distribution we wanted to verify against and the test suite was then responsible for cycling through the different distributions. This gives us the ability to test multiple kubernetes distributions against the same exact test cases.

The individual test cases were also rewritten to not rely on terratest running a bash command over ssh. Instead, the test uses the locally built Zarf binary and example packages to validate expected behavior. This approach works both on local dev machines (linux/mac) and on the Ubuntu GitHub Runner that gets triggered when a pull request is created. This also has the positive side effect of not needing to wait several minutes for an ec2 instance to spin up for testing.

Since we no longer need repository secrets to run the E2E tests, we removed the requirement for a maintainer to use a `/test all` chatops command to dispatch the tests. Instead, there is a new test workflow defined for each kubernetes distribution we are verifying against and the tests get run automatically whenever a PR is created or updated.

When looking back at the list of 'important additions' we were considering above. All three are addressed with this approach. Testing against different kubernetes distributions is as simple as defining how to create and destroy the cluster. All of the test cases are runnable locally and then because of that testing on a linux distribution is possible by just switching over to another machine and running the same `make test-e2e` there. This also gives us the ability to test against cloud distributions like EKS! All you need is a valid kubeconfig and running `go test ./...` in the `./src/test/e2e` directory will run all of the test cases against the EKS cluster."

In order to create any workloads in K8s, an image has to exist on the node or be pulled in from an OCI Distribution server (docker registry). Local K8s distros such as KIND, K3D, K3S, Microk8s have CLI support for injecting or pushing images into the CRIs of cluster nodes. No standard or tool exists to do this generically in K8s as the CRI sits outside the problem of K8s beyond just communicating with it. For Zarf to push images into a K8s cluster that does not have a CLI option to inject the image, we have to establish some mechanism to create a temporary registry, use an existing one, or inject the image in the cluster. Zarf must also support unknown environments with no other dependencies; we cannot assume a registry exists. Typically when K8s pulls images from a remote registry, it sends the request to the CRI that then does the pull outside of the K8s context. The CRI runs at the host level on a per-node basis, so to access a private registry, the TLS trust needs to be modified on any host/node that would attempt to pull the image. The two primary ways to do this are modifying the node's root certificate authorities or the CRIs configuration if it has an option for TLS root CA. Lastly, as this is per node, all nodes in the cluster would need to be modified or some affinity/taint to force the pod to use a single node during bootstrapping.","## Decision 
To support image injection into Kubernetes clusters without assuming existing CLI options or registries, Zarf will implement a flexible, fallback image distribution strategy:
1. Whenever possible, use the native CLI mechanisms provided by local Kubernetes distributions (e.g., KIND, K3D, K3S, Microk8s) to push or inject container images directly into cluster node CRIs.
2. For environments lacking such CLI support or existing internal registries, Zarf will create a temporary container registry within the cluster as an ephemeral, trusted image source. This registry will be dynamically deployed and configured with appropriate TLS trust so cluster nodes can securely pull images.
3. Zarf will also support injecting images by modifying nodes directly, including updating root certificate authorities or configuring the CRI to trust custom registries, when feasible and safe to do so, ensuring that all relevant nodes are configured consistently.
4. To mitigate complexity and ensure reliable access, Zarf may taint or set affinity on pods during bootstrap to run on nodes with proper image trust configured.
5. All implementations will prioritize zero-dependency operation and compatibility with unknown environments where no native registry or injection support exists.
This strategy ensures robust support for image distribution, respects the architecture of Kubernetes and CRIs, and recognizes the practical constraints of node-level TLS configuration and multi-node clusters.","## Decision

Because we cannot require third-party dependencies, the requirement from some cloud-managed or distro-managed registry is not an option as not every K8s cluster will have that available.  Running an in-memory registry while zarf is performing `zarf init` was initially explored to resolve the external dependency issue.  However, this solution proved too complex when dealing with network traversal (especially behind NATs), firewall, and NACL rulesets.  Additionally, because of the complexities around TLS trust, the in-memory registry was not a viable solution.

After iterating on several solutions, including `kubectl cp`, `kubectl exec`, a busybox configmap injection that brought in netcat to stream files, and a few variations on those ideas, we found using only configmaps to be the most predictable method for injection. The challenge with this mode is that the ETCD limit is 1 MB total, with binary data base64-encoded leaving roughly 670 KBs of data per configmap, far too small to bring the registry tarball in a single configmap. So instead, we used a combination of a custom Rust binary compiled with MUSL to perform file concatenation, untarring, and verification of a set of split tarball chunks across a variable number of configmaps. We found that chunking by less than the near-maximum configmap size was more performant on some resource-constrained control planes. The details of this solution and a drawing are located in the main README of this repo."

SBOM are required for software running on government hardware per EO14028.","## Decision
To comply with Executive Order 14028, Arachne will integrate automated Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation into its build and release processes. This will ensure that every software artifact produced includes a detailed SBOM documenting all included components and their versions. The SBOM generation will follow widely accepted industry standards (such as SPDX or CycloneDX) to maximize interoperability and transparency. Additionally, the build system and deployment pipelines will be updated to enforce SBOM presence as a prerequisite for software release to government hardware environments. This approach guarantees compliance with EO14028 while maintaining a clear, auditable software supply chain for all Arachne deployments.","## Decision

Using Witness' Syft attestor functionality allows Zarf to continue to get more refined SBOM capabilities as Witness' capabilities expand over time. Syft is capable of finding installed packages and some binaries for statically compiled dependencies over each image within a Zarf package. This allows for SBOMs for each image to be generated and packaged along with the Zarf package.  Abilities to export the SBOM to SDPX and CycloneDX formatted documents as well as a browse-able web page are in works."
"## Context

Currently Zarf leverages [Helm Post Rendering](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/advanced/#post-rendering) to mutate image paths and secrets for K8s to use the internal [Zarf Registry](../packages/zarf-registry/). This works well for simple K8s deployments where Zarf is performing the actual manifest apply but fails when using a secondary gitops tools suchs as [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), etc. At that point, Zarf is unable to provide mutation and it is dependent on the package author to do the mutations themselves using rudimentary templating. Further, this issue also exists when for CRDs that references the [git server](../packages/gitea/). A `zarf prepare` command was added previously to make this less painful, but it still requires additional burden on package authors to do something we are able to prescribe in code.","## Decision 
We will implement a dedicated manifest mutation phase as part of the Zarf package deployment pipeline that operates independently of Helm’s post-rendering.
This phase will:
1. Take rendered Kubernetes manifests as input.
2. Programmatically locate and mutate image paths, secrets, and references to the internal Zarf Registry.
3. Handle CRDs and custom resources such as those referencing the git server automatically.
4. Be decoupled from the deployment tool used, allowing compatibility with GitOps tools like Flux and ArgoCD.
5. Provide a high-level API and reusable libraries for package authors to integrate standard mutation logic without manual templating.
This approach will restore the ability for Zarf to fully control and prescribe manifest transformations, reducing the burden on package authors, and improving consistency and reliability across deployment methods.","## Decision

A [mutating webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/) is standard practice in K8s and there [are a lot of them](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#what-does-each-admission-controller-do). Using the normal Zarf component structure and deployment strategy we can leverage a mutating webhook to perform automatic imagePullSecret binding and image path updates as well as add additional as-needed mutations such as updating the [GitRepository](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/source/gitrepositories/) CRD with the appropriate secret and custom URL for the git server if someone is using Flux."

In ADR 3, the decision was made to create a rust binary (`stage1`) that would re-assemble a `registry:2` image and a go registry binary (`stage2`) from a series of configmaps. While this solution works, it is overkill for the operations that `stage2` performs. The `stage2` binary is only responsible for 1. starting a docker registry in `rw` mode, 2. pushing the `registry:2` crane tarball into said registry, 3. starting the docker registry in `r` mode. This `registry:2` image is then immediately consumed by the `zarf-registry` package, creating a true in-cluster docker registry. The injector pod is then destroyed. The overhead this operation creates:

- having to keep track of another binary (making the total number 3 for the zarf ecosystem)
- nearly doubling the amount of configmaps loaded into the cluster (makes init slower)
- having to compile the binary for each platform (adds to the build time + ci)
- using a full-featured docker registry to host a single image (wasteful)","## Decision 
We will replace the current two-stage initialization process involving the `stage1` Rust binary and the `stage2` Go binary with a simplified approach that eliminates the need for `stage1`.
Instead, a streamlined `stage2` will be enhanced to directly handle:
1. Starting the docker registry in read-write mode.
2. Pushing the `registry:2` crane tarball into the registry.
3. Restarting the docker registry in read-only mode.
This change reduces operational complexity by:
- Removing the need to maintain and build the additional `stage1` binary across multiple platforms.
- Reducing the total number of configmaps loaded into the cluster, speeding up initialization.
- Avoiding the overhead of running a full-featured docker registry solely to host a single image.
This decision favors simplicity and efficiency, streamlining the injection workflow while still enabling creation of the in-cluster docker registry consumed by the `zarf-registry` package.
The injector pod will continue to be destroyed after initialization to minimize resource usage.","## Decision

The rust binary is already being injected via configmap and unpacking the tarball. There is little need to bring everything but the kitchen sink to just serve a single image. Therefore the decision is to use the rust binary to perform the entire injection process. This required a few changes to the rust binary:

- not only re-assemble + unpack the tarball, but also unpack the `registry:2` image (stored as a [crane tarball format](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/pkg/v1/tarball))
- transform the `registry:2` crane manifest to a docker v2 manifest
- spin up an HTTP server compliant with the v2 docker registry API to serve the `registry:2` image"

There are sections of the code that are not easily able to be tested by our end-to-end testing and now that Zarf is moving into being a library for other products there will be more scrutiny around our defined interfaces.  This ADR explores ways that we could adjust our testing strategy to address these concerns.

Potential considerations:

1. Introduce Unit-Testing Zarf-wide
    Pros:
        - More of the codebase is covered with tests and will force us to take more consideration when updating it
    Cons:
        - As the codebase evolves the efficacy of these tests is likely to go down, especially if they are written to the code rather than the interface

2. Introduce Unit Testing in a defined and limited capacity within Zarf
    Pros:
        - A decent amount of the codebase will be tested (specifically we can target those areas difficult to e2e test)
        - We can be picky about what/where we unit test so that the maintenance burden of the tests is not too high
    Cons:
        - We will need to be vigilant when PRs come through with Unit Tests that these are correct applications of them

3. Introduce Integration Testing or partial End-to-End testing
    Pros:
        - This is closer to how we already test within Zarf
    Cons:
        - These can be relatively complex to orchestrate and maintain over time requiring complex mocks or other mechanisms to make them work","## Decision 
We will introduce a defined and limited capacity of unit testing within Zarf, focusing primarily on those parts of the codebase that are difficult or impossible to cover adequately with end-to-end testing.
This approach balances the need to increase code coverage and interface scrutiny while controlling the maintenance burden associated with unit tests.
Specific guidelines will be established to ensure unit tests target the public interfaces and well-defined internal modules rather than implementation details that are subject to frequent changes.
Code reviewers will be vigilant to ensure that unit tests added in PRs align with these guidelines and provide meaningful coverage without increasing test fragility.
Integration and end-to-end tests will continue to be the primary testing strategy, complemented by these targeted unit tests to cover edge cases and internal logic that cannot be exercised otherwise.","## Decision

It was decided to introduce a limited set of unit tests to the Zarf codebase (2) because this will enable us the most flexibility and control over how we test while also allowing us to specifically target specific units without a ton of overhead.  Specifically we will ask the following before implementing a Unit Test:

1. Is what I want to test a true unit (i.e. a single function or file)?
2. Does what I want to test have a clearly defined interface (i.e. a public specification)?
3. Is this code inside of the `src/pkg` folder or should it be?"

Images are not the only way that dependencies can be brought in via a Zarf package (our own init package has two components that are not images yet could have vulnerabilities within them, k3s and the injector).  We should SBOM these in addition to images so that we are providing a more complete picture to our users.

Potential considerations:

1. Run Syft against the entire zarf temp build directory
    Pros:
        - This would provide the most information for what _might_ be in a Zarf package
    Cons:
        - If git repos are brought in you could catch many index files that are actually not in the package but are dependencies of the repos leading to confusion

2. Run Syft against files and dataInjections
    Pros:
        - We know these files are actually inside of the package and won't just be noise
        - This is the most common two ways for people to include additional artifacts in packages (we use files in our own init package)
    Cons:
        - This is only a subset of what Zarf provides and someone could commit an artifact to a git repo for example

3. Allow user flexibility in what gets SBOMed
    Pros:
        - This provides the user the most flexibility
    Cons:
        - This could be complex to get right on implementation and if it were optional may be a forgotten feature by most users","## Decision 
We will generate SBOMs for Zarf packages by running Syft on both container images and additional artifact types, including files and data injections included in the package. This approach strikes a balance between coverage and noise:
- Syft will be run against all container images inside the Zarf package, ensuring these primary components have comprehensive SBOMs.
- Syft will also be run against files and data injections explicitly included in the package, capturing non-image artifacts known to be inside the package.
- We will not run Syft on the entire temporary build directory (including git repos) to avoid noise from indirect dependencies not actually packaged.
- To provide flexibility, we will design the SBOM generation configuration to allow users to specify additional artifact paths or types to include, enabling advanced users to customize their SBOM coverage as needed.
- By default, users get robust coverage of primary artifact types without overwhelming noise or complexity.
This decision enables more complete SBOMs for Zarf packages while managing complexity and minimizing false positives from indirect or external dependencies.","## Decision

It was decided that we would SBOM the files and dataInjections inclusions by component (2) and include them into our SBOM viewer that way.  This will allow us to characterize what SBOMing in Zarf may look like going forward without introducing something that is just optional or that might make too much noise at first blush."

Zarf was rooted in the idea of declarative K8s deployments for disconnected environments. Many of the design decisions made in Zarf are based on this idea. However, in certain connected environments, Zarf can still be leveraged as a way to define declarative deployments and upgrades without the constraints of disconnected environments. To that end, providing a declarative way to deploy Zarf packages without the need for a Zarf init package would be useful in such environments.","## Decision 
We will extend Zarf to support a fully declarative deployment mode that allows users to deploy Zarf packages directly, without the need for a Zarf init package.
This mode will enable connected environments to leverage Zarf's declarative deployment benefits without the constraints imposed by disconnected environment requirements.
The declarative deployment mode will:
- Accept a comprehensive package descriptor that defines all necessary deployment parameters.
- Manage package dependencies and upgrades in a declarative manner.
- Allow idempotent deployment and upgrades via standard Kubernetes mechanisms.
- Provide clear feedback and status reporting for deployment progress and outcomes.
By decoupling deployment from the init package, this approach increases flexibility while maintaining consistency with Zarf's core declarative design principles.","## Decision

YOLO mode is an optional boolean config set in the `metadata` section of the Zarf package manifest. Setting `metadata.yolo=true` will deploy the Zarf package ""as is"" without needing the Zarf state to exist or the Zarf Agent mutating webhook. Zarf packages with YOLO mode enabled are not allowed to specify components with container images or Git repos and validation will prevent the package from being created."

Originally, the `scripts` noun was added to components to allow us to move hard-coded init business logic out of the codebase and into the package system. At the time there was only a `before` and `after` section with simply an array entry per command. Later, `prepare` was added as a way to do something during `zarf package create`. As teams began to find new ways to use the capabilities, their limitations became more obvious.","## Decision  
We will extend the `scripts` noun schema to support multiple named phases beyond just `before`, `after`, and `prepare`. This will allow components to declare finely-grained lifecycle script hooks that better fit diverse initialization and packaging scenarios.  
Key points:  
- The `scripts` noun will be a map of phase names (e.g. `before`, `prepare`, `after`, plus any new custom phases) each mapping to a list of scripts or commands to run.  
- Each script entry can include metadata to control execution details like environment, dependencies, failure handling, and order within the phase.  
- Phase definitions will be extensible so teams can add new lifecycle hooks as needed.  
- The executor will run scripts in the sequence defined by the phase ordering, ensuring predictable component initialization and packaging workflows.  
- Backwards compatibility with existing `before` and `after` array-style scripts will be maintained during transition.  
This approach enables more expressive and maintainable component lifecycle scripting fit for evolving operational requirements.","## Decision

The `scripts` section of the `zarf.yaml` will be replaced with a new `actions` section. The `actions` section will be a map of action names to a list of commands to run. `actions` will contain `action sets` that map to the following lifecycle events:

- `onCreate` - Runs during `zarf package create`
- `onDeploy` - Runs during `zarf package deploy`
- `onRemove` - Runs during `zarf package remove`

In addition to adding more lifecycle events, the `actions` section will also allow for more complex actions to be defined. New configurations include, setting the cmd directory, defining custom env variables, setting the number of retries, setting the max total seconds, muting the output, and [setting a variable](../docs/3-create-a-zarf-package/7-component-actions.md#creating-dynamic-variables-from-actions) to be used in other actions or components.

Further details can be found in the `component-actions` [component actions documentation](../docs/3-create-a-zarf-package/7-component-actions.md), [package create lifecycle documentation](../docs/3-create-a-zarf-package/5-package-create-lifecycle.md), [package deploy lifecycle documentation](../docs/4-deploy-a-zarf-package/1-package-deploy-lifecycle.md), and the [example package](../examples/component-actions/README.md)."
"## Context

There has been a long-standing usability gap with Zarf when doing local development due to a lack of local image support. A solution was merged in, [#1173](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/pull/1173), and released in [v0.23.4](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/releases/tag/v0.23.4) to support this feature. Unfortunately, we didn't realize there is a [glaring issue](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/1214) with the implementation that causes Zarf to crash when trying to load large images into the local docker daemon.  The docker daemon support in Crane is somewhat naive and can send a machine into an OOM condition due to how the tar stream is loaded into memory from the docker save action. Crane does have an option to avoid this issue, but at the cost of being much slower to load images from docker.

We did extensive investigation into various strategies of loading docker images from the daemon including: crane, skopeo, the docker go client and executing the docker cli directly with varying levels of success. Unfortunately, some of the methods that did work well were up to 3 times slower than the current implementation, though they avoided the OOM issue. Lastly, the docker daemon save operations directly still ended up being slower than crane and docker produced a legacy format that would cause issues with [future package schema changes](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/1319) we are planning for oci imports.

|                                                    | **Docker** | **Crane** |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Big Bang Core (cached)                             | 3m 1s      | 1m 58s    |
| Big Bang Core (cached + skip-sbom)                 | 1m 51s     | 56s       |
| 20 GB Single-Layer Image (local registry)          |            | 6m 14s    |
| 20 GB Single-Layer Image (local registry + cached) | 5m 2s      | 2m 10s    |","## Decision 
To address the local image loading issues in Zarf, we will continue using Crane by default for loading images into the local Docker daemon because of its superior speed performance compared to alternatives.
However, to prevent crashes and OOM conditions caused by Crane’s memory-intensive loading method, we will introduce a configurable option to enable a slower but safer loading mode that avoids loading the entire tar stream into memory at once.
We will:
1. Retain Crane as the primary image loading tool given its performance advantages.
2. Implement and expose a configuration flag or environment variable that, when enabled, switches Crane into a streaming mode that avoids OOM but is significantly slower.
3. Document the trade-offs clearly for users to understand when to enable the safer loading mode (such as when loading very large images).
4. Continue monitoring upstream fixes or improvements in Crane, Docker Go client, and other tools in order to revisit this decision if a better solution becomes available.
5. Avoid using direct Docker CLI or skopeo due to legacy format issues and slower performance.
This approach balances usability and stability for local development, addressing the immediate OOM issue while preserving an efficient default.","## Decision

We had hoped to leverage docker caching and avoid crane caching more, but realized that caching was still occurring via Syft for SBOM. Additionally, the extremely-large, local-only image is actually the edge case here and we created a recommended workaround in the FAQs as well as an inline alert when a large docker image is detected. This restores behavior to what it was before the docker daemon support was added, but with the added benefit of being able to load images from the docker daemon when they are available locally."
"## Context

One primary application component that end users of Zarf are deploying is [Big Bang](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang). The installation of Big Bang is complicated for several reasons:

- It requires Flux to be installed to deploy correctly due to the use of Flux CRDs.
- The [images](https://umbrella-bigbang-releases.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/umbrella/1.51.0/package-images.yaml) defined within Big Bang are normally a superset of the images needed for any individual deployment.
- All images that Big Bang might need takes 10s of gigabytes of storage to include in a Zarf package.
- The git repositories defined within Big Bang are normally a superset of the git repositories needed for any individual deployment.
- Injecting a `values.yaml` file into the [default deployment structure](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/blob/master/base/kustomization.yaml) is complicated and the discovery of which images are needed is a function of the values that are provided to the Big Bang chart","## Decision 
To address the complexity of deploying Big Bang with Zarf, we will implement a tailored packaging and deployment strategy with the following key elements:
1. Flux Pre-installation: Ensure that Flux is installed as a prerequisite by including a dedicated step in the Zarf deployment workflow to install Flux and its CRDs before deploying Big Bang.
2. Selective Inclusion of Images: Rather than including all Big Bang images in the Zarf package, implement a mechanism to analyze the specific deployment values (`values.yaml`) provided by the user to determine the subset of images actually required. Only those images will be included in the package to optimize storage footprint.
3. Minimizing Git Repositories: Similarly, the set of git repositories included in the deployment will be minimized based on the specific configuration, avoiding unnecessary repositories that would otherwise bloat the package.
4. Custom Values Injection: Provide tooling within Zarf to inject or merge user-supplied `values.yaml` files into the Big Bang deployment manifests in a way that respects the expected structure and discovery mechanisms of the Big Bang chart.
5. Automation and Documentation: Automate these processes as much as possible within Zarf's packaging workflow and provide clear documentation to users about the assumptions and steps involved.
By taking this approach, we maintain the flexibility of Big Bang deployments while controlling package size and complexity, ensuring efficient and reliable installations with Zarf.","## Decision

Deployments of Big Bang can be managed with a new `bigbang` noun in the zarf.yaml that manages the complexity of the deployment. This capability will take the values provided to the big bang chart, template them during the package phase to identify which [Big Bang packages](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/blob/master/docs/packages.md) are being configured in the Zarf package. The code then includes only the git repositories and images needed for the configured packages, and does not include the git repositories and images for packages that would not be deployed.

The `bigbang` section will provide the following configurations for managing a big bang deployment:

- `version` - Identifies the particular version of Big Bang to deploy, which corresponds to git tags in the provided `repo`. See versions of Big Bang [here](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/releases).
- `repo` - Identifies the git repository Big Bang is hosted on. Defaults to https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang.git
- `valuesFiles` - list of local files that get passed to the Big Bang helm chart for deployment.
- `skipFlux` - boolean to determine if the flux installation for Big Bang should be skipped. Only set this to true if flux has been deployed in a different way already in the cluster."
"## Context

Zarf packages are currently only available if built locally or through manual file transfers. This is not a scalable way to distribute packages. We wanted to find a way to distribute and publish packages in a way that is easily consumable for the majority of users. When considering the goal of being able to share packages, security and trust are very important considerations. We wanted our publishing solution and architecture changes to keep in mind signing of packages and the ability to verify the integrity of packages.

We know we are successful when:

1. (Priority) Users can use Zarf to natively publish a Zarf package to an OCI compliant registry
2. (Secondary goal) Package creators can sign Zarf packages to enable package deployers can trust a packages supply chain security","## Decision
We will enhance Zarf to support native publishing and consuming of Zarf packages via OCI-compliant registries. This allows users to push and pull packages in a standardized, scalable manner without manual file transfers.

Key components of this decision:

1. **OCI Registry Integration**: 
   - Implement mechanisms to package Zarf bundles as OCI artifacts.
   - Provide CLI commands for publishing to and retrieving from OCI registries.

2. **Package Signing and Verification**:
   - Integrate cryptographic signing of Zarf packages at publish time.
   - Enable consumers to verify package signatures upon retrieval to ensure supply chain security and package integrity.

3. **User Experience**:
   - Maintain simplicity for users publishing packages, abstracting complexity of OCI interactions.
   - Provide clear documentation on signing and verification processes.

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Ensure that signing keys and verification processes adhere to best practices.
   - Enable configurable trust policies for deployment scenarios.

By implementing this approach, we will achieve scalable, secure package distribution while supporting user trust through signature verification.","## Decision

We decided that changing the structure of Zarf packages to be an OCI artifact would be the best way to distribute and publish packages as registries are already an integral part of the container ecosystem."
"## Context

Zarf currently supports git servers and container registries within the airgap to host dependencies for applications, and while this works well for most production deployments, it doesn't cater as well to airgap development where you may need artifacts and libraries for various coding languages to compile and develop software.  Zarf's support of `git` is also somewhat lacking in that it only supports flux `GitRepository` objects and does not support more generic use cases where clients try to reach out to upstream `git` hosts in a more native way.","## Decision 
Zarf will be enhanced to better support airgap development scenarios by expanding its artifact hosting capabilities beyond just git servers and container registries. Specifically:
1. Support will be added for hosting and serving artifacts and libraries for various programming languages to facilitate compilation and development within airgapped environments.
2. The existing git support will be improved to handle more generic use cases beyond flux `GitRepository` objects, enabling clients to interact with upstream git hosts in a more native manner.
3. These enhancements will maintain compatibility with existing production deployments while providing improved flexibility for development workflows.
4. Care will be taken to ensure secure and reliable artifact management and distribution within the airgap.
This will enable Zarf to better cater to the needs of developers working in completely isolated environments, making it easier to build and compile software without external connectivity.","## Decision

Since we already had an artifact registry available to us in Gitea, it was decided to utilize that as the default provider for this functionality in addition to matching the external support for `git` and `registry` servers with a new `artifact` server specification on `init`.  From here, to access the configured server we had two main options:

1. Transform any artifact references statically (i.e. swap upstream URLs in build scripts before bringing them into the environment)
2. Transform any artifact references dynamically (i.e. swap upstream URLs in an active proxy that any build scripts could pickup through DNS)

It was decided to go with #2 since this would allow us to support a wider array of build technologies (including those that wrap existing commands like Buck/Bazel/Make) as well as support builds that may be coming from resources not brought in by Zarf.  This allows for more flexibility in how Zarf could transform URLs while allowing these commands to run as they would on the internet side without any modification."
"## Context

Eventually, Zarf needs to become a ""Generally Available"" v1.x.x product that people can rely on for mission-critical operations.  Today, Zarf can be used in these environments; though, it requires someone more involved in the Zarf lifecycle than a normal consumer/user to make that successful due to the regular introduction of breaking changes and the lack of testing in certain areas.","## Decision  
To achieve ""Generally Available"" v1.x.x status for Zarf, we will adopt a rigorous versioning and testing strategy to ensure stability and reliability for mission-critical operations.  
Key points:  
1. Establish a clear semantic versioning policy that communicates backward compatibility and breaking changes transparently to users.  
2. Implement comprehensive automated testing across all critical components, including integration and system tests, to catch regressions early.  
3. Introduce a formal release cycle with milestones, release candidates, and staged rollouts to reduce risk.  
4. Improve documentation to clearly indicate stability guarantees, upgrade paths, and known limitations.  
5. Engage the user and contributor community in validating release candidates and providing feedback on stability and usability.  
6. Strive for backward compatibility in APIs and configuration wherever possible. When breaking changes are necessary, provide tools and migration guides to ease upgrades.  
This disciplined approach will reduce the need for deep involvement by expert maintainers for normal users, facilitating broader adoption of Zarf for mission-critical applications.","## Decision

To make Zarf a Generally Available product we need to focus on overall stability and mechanisms to ensure long-term stability.  ""Stability,"" in this case, is both that of the features we release and of the APIs and schemas we present to Zarf consumers.

To increase this stability, we decided to implement the following:

- [ ] Mechanism/branching strategy to backport patch fixes to older minor releases
- [x] Clear definition of `released`, `beta`, and `alpha` features, including a matrix of their support across OSes
- [ ] Clear definition of when backward compatibility checks are going to be removed with clear messaging to users
- [ ] End to End testing that covers the `released` features outlined in that feature matrix - this should also be done:
  - across operating systems (specifically: Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - across major k8s distros (specifically: K3d, K3s, Minikube, Kind, EKS, AKS, OpenShift)
  - across registry providers (specifically: Docker Distribution, ECR, ACR)
  - across git providers (specifically: Gitea, GitLab)
- [ ] Unit testing that covers our library code (`src/pkg`) for people using Zarf as a library (code coverage metric TBD)
- [ ] Mechanisms and tests to not break compatibility with packages built with older versions of Zarf
- [ ] Mechanisms to notify users when they may need to upgrade the Zarf Agent (or Pepr capability)
- [ ] Mechanisms to ensure users can easily access documentation specific to the version of Zarf they use
- [ ] Mechanisms to ensure a more seamless Zarf install experience (i.e., macOS binary signing, `sudo apk add zarf`, `asdf install zarf X.X.X`)
- [ ] Regularly published/maintained example package(s) for tutorials/quick install
- [ ] Clear definition/strategy for ""what Zarf is"" including clear docs on how to use `released` features

"## Context

The idea of `hooks` is to provide a way for cluster maintainers to register functionality that runs during the deployment lifecycle. Zarf packages already have the concept of `actions` that can execute commands on the host machine's shell during certain package lifecycle events. As `actions` gain more adoption, the team has noticed they are being used to add functionality to Zarf in unexpected ways. We want `actions` to be a tool that extends upon the functionality of Zarf and its packages, not a tool that works around missing or clunky functionality.

We want package creators to be able to create system agnostic packages by leveraging core Zarf functionality. The following is one such scenario:

- _IF_ ECR is chosen as the external registry during `zarf init` / cluster creation, _THEN_ Zarf will seamlessly leverage ECR without requiring advanced user effort.

Using ECR as a remote registry creates 2 problems that Zarf will need to solve:

 1. ECR authentication tokens expire after 12 hours and need to be refreshed. This means the cluster will need to constantly be refreshing its tokens and the user deploying packages will need to make sure they have a valid token.
 2. ECR Image Repositories do not support 'push-to-create'. This means we will need to explicitly create an image repository for every image that is being pushed within the Zarf package.

Packages that get deployed onto a cluster initialized with ECR as its remote registry will need to make sure it solves these 2 problems.

Currently there are 2 solutions:

1. The package deployer solves the problem pre-deployment (creating needed repos, secrets, etc...)
2. The package itself solves these problems with `actions` that are custom built for ECR clusters.

Neither one of these current solutions are ideal. We don't want to require overly complex external + prior actions for Zarf package deployments, and we don't want package creators to have to create and distribute packages that are specific to ECR.

Potential considerations:","## Decision 
We will introduce a dedicated `hooks` system within Zarf that enables cluster maintainers to register lifecycle-integrated functions to run at designated points during deployment without relying on ad-hoc `actions`.
The hooks will be designed to encapsulate and abstract cluster-specific operational concerns such as ECR authentication token refresh and pre-creation of image repositories.
This separation will ensure:
- Package creators can build system-agnostic packages that leverage built-in Zarf core functionality, without needing to embed cluster-specific logic or actions.
- Cluster maintainers can provide cluster-specific operational logic transparently and reliably, improving user experience by removing the need for manual pre-deployment steps or bespoke package actions.
- Lifecycle hooks can be tied to well-defined lifecycle events (e.g., pre-deploy, post-deploy) to automatically handle operational requirements such as token refresh or repository creation.
Implementation will consider maintaining hooks as first-class entities managed by the cluster configuration or initialization process, and ensure good observability and failure handling around hook execution.
`Actions` will remain for user-defined package-level command execution, but their use will be discouraged for cluster-specific operational needs that hooks address more cleanly.","## Decision

[Pepr](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/pepr) will be used to enable custom, or environment-specific, automation tasks to be integrated in the Zarf package deployment lifecycle. Pepr also allows the Zarf codebase to remain agnostic to any third-party APIs or dependencies that may be used.

A `--skip-webhooks` flag has been added to `zarf package deploy` to allow users to opt out of Zarf checking and waiting for any webhooks to complete during package deployments."
"## Context

We need a way to decouple transformations from Zarf. We know the Zarf transformation library is battle tested, hardened, and reliable. As Pepr takes admission responsibilities from the Zarf Agent, we need a way to synchronize the TypeScript with the Go code instead of maintaining two disparate libraries which will be expected to grow.

We considered:

- WASM
- gRPC
- REST
- Rewrite the code in TypeScript","## Decision  
We will adopt a gRPC-based communication layer to decouple the transformations from Zarf. This approach allows us to keep the existing, battle-tested Go transformation library intact without rewriting it in TypeScript.  
Advantages include:  
- Strongly typed, language-agnostic interface, enabling synchronization between Go and TypeScript codebases.  
- Efficient binary communication with support for streaming and multiplexing.  
- Facilities for maintaining a single source of truth for transformations in Go, reducing duplication and inconsistency.  
Alternative approaches like WASM or REST were discarded due to complexity or inefficiency, and rewriting code in TypeScript was rejected to avoid duplicating effort and risking inconsistencies.  
The gRPC interface will be defined and maintained alongside the existing Go codebase, and TypeScript clients will be generated to reflect any changes promptly. This ensures synchronized development and reduces maintenance overhead.","## Decision

We conformed around using WASM because we can leverage the battle tested transform library from Zarf without incurring network overhead cost from pod to pod or container to container communications."
"## Context

Zarf natively supports creating the following package sources:

- Local Tarball (`.tar` and `.tar.zst`)
  - Via `zarf package create <dir> -o <dir>`, with compression determined by `metadata.uncompressed` in `zarf.yaml`
- Split Tarball (`.part...`)
  - Via `zarf package create <dir> --max-package-size <size> -o <dir>`
- OCI package (`oci://`)
  - Via `zarf package publish <source> oci://` or `zarf package create <dir> -o oci://...`
- In-cluster (Deployed) package
  - Post `zarf package deploy <source>` the package is show in `zarf package list`

However, the current loading abilities of Zarf have been inconsistent depending upon the action specified. For example:

- Split tarball packages could be created, deployed, but not inspected, or removed
- In-cluster packages could be removed (by name), but not inspected
- HTTPs URLs could be deployed, but not inspected, or removed
- etc...","## Decision
We will unify the package source interfaces in Zarf to support a consistent set of operations across all source types. Specifically, any package source type (Local Tarball, Split Tarball, OCI package, In-cluster package, HTTPs URLs, etc.) will support the following core actions where applicable:

- Create (if the source type supports creation)
- Deploy
- Inspect
- Remove

To achieve this, we will abstract the package sources behind a common interface defining these operations. Each package source implementation will provide concrete behavior for these actions.

Additionally, we will:

- Implement missing operations for sources which currently do not support them, e.g., allowing inspection and removal of split tarball and in-cluster packages.
- Ensure consistent error handling and user feedback when operations are unsupported for certain package types.
- Update CLI commands and documentation to reflect parity in supported actions across all package types.

This unified approach will improve usability, transparency, and predictability of package management in Zarf.","## Decision

Zarf must support the `deploy`, `inspect`, `remove`, `publish`, `pull`, and `mirror-resources` commands across package sources.

For common behavior to be exhibited by all sources, the `PackageSource` interface has been introduced along with the `layout` library.

```go
// src/pkg/packager/sources/new.go

// PackageSource is an interface for package sources.
//
// While this interface defines three functions, LoadPackage, LoadPackageMetadata, and Collect; only one of them should be used within a packager function.
//
// These functions currently do not promise repeatability due to the side effect nature of loading a package.
type PackageSource interface {
    // LoadPackage loads a package from a source.
    //
    // For the default sources included in Zarf, package integrity (checksums, signatures, etc.) is validated during this function
    // and expects the package structure to follow the default Zarf package structure.
    //
    // If your package does not follow the default Zarf package structure, you will need to implement your own source.
    LoadPackage(*layout.PackagePaths) error
    // LoadPackageMetadata loads a package's metadata from a source.
    //
    // This function follows the same principles as LoadPackage, with a few exceptions:
    //
    // - Package integrity validation will display a warning instead of returning an error if
    //   the package is signed but no public key is provided. This is to allow for the inspection and removal of packages
    //   that are signed but the user does not have the public key for.
    LoadPackageMetadata(dst *layout.PackagePaths, wantSBOM bool, skipValidation bool) error

    // Collect relocates a package from its source to a tarball in a given destination directory.
    Collect(destinationDirectory string) (tarball string, err error)
}
```

The following sources have been implemented:

- Local Tarball (`.tar` and `.tar.zst`)
- Split Tarball (`.part...`)
- HTTP(S) URL
- Published OCI package (`oci://`)
- In-cluster (Deployed) package (`inspect` and `remove` only)

The `layout` library contains the `PackagePaths` struct which supersedes the prior `TempPaths` struct. This new struct contains access methods to different aspects of Zarf's internal package layout. This struct is passed to the `PackageSource` functions to allow for the loading of packages into the correct layout. In order for a package to be loaded into the correct layout, the package must follow the default Zarf package structure, or be converted to the expected structure during loading operations."
"## Context

Zarf has supports composing components together between packages on `zarf package create` since v0.16.0.  This has allowed package creators to make more complex packages from smaller reusable bits.  As this functionality grew however there were a few problems that developed:

1. Import chains did not handle scaling to larger numbers of layers with test coverage usually only covering the first import.
2. When OCI skeletons were added they were largely bolted on after the fact without rethinking how they would impact composability.
3. Component filtering via the `only` filter was not implemented in a central location leading to bugs with create-time filters.","## Decision
We will refactor the component composition system to centralize and unify handling of import chains, OCI skeletons, and filtering logic.

1. A single, core import resolution engine will be built to handle deep import chains robustly, ensuring scalability and comprehensive test coverage across all layers.
2. OCI skeleton support will be fully integrated into the core import process rather than being bolted on, guaranteeing consistent behavior and easier maintenance.
3. Component filtering (including the `only` filter) will be implemented within this centralized import engine to eliminate inconsistencies and bugs arising from decentralized filter handling.

By unifying these functions into a single compositional framework, we will improve reliability, maintainability, and extensibility of package composition in Zarf.","## Decision

We decided to separate composability into its own package that represents a composability import chain as a doubly linked list.  This allows us to represent the whole chain as it exists relative to the ""head"" Zarf package (the definition that Zarf was asked to build) to more easily handle packages that are in different locations (such as OCI skeletons in one's cache).  We also run the compose functions on all components so that the additional filter logic that is needed for these components can be handled more concisely and built upon (as it might for `flavor` https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/2101)."

> Feature request: <https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/2169>

The current package development lifecycle is:

1. Create a `zarf.yaml` file and add components
2. Create a package with `zarf package create <dir>`
3. Debug any create errors and resolve by editing `zarf.yaml` and repeating step 2
4. Run `zarf init` to initialize the cluster
5. Deploy the package with `zarf package deploy <tarball>`
6. Debug any deploy errors and resolve by editing `zarf.yaml` and repeating step 2 or 5

If there are deployment errors, the common pattern is to reset the cluster (ex: `k3d cluster delete && k3d cluster create`) and repeat steps 4-6. Re-initializing the cluster, recreating the package, and redeploying the package is tedious and time consuming; especially when the package is large or the change was small.

`zarf package create` is designed around air-gapped environments where the package is created in one environment and deployed in another. Due to this architecture, a package's dependencies _must_ be retrieved and assembled _each_ and _every_ time.

There already exists the concept of [`YOLO` mode](0010-yolo-mode.md), which can build + deploy a package without the need for `zarf init`, and builds without fetching certain heavy dependencies (like Docker images). However, `YOLO` mode is not exposed via CLI flags, and is meant to develop and deploy packages in fully connected environments.","## Decision 
We will introduce a new CLI option `--fast-create` (name subject to refinement) to the `zarf package create` command that will enable incremental package creation without fetching all dependencies every time.
This mode will:
- Cache dependencies and artifacts locally on the developer's machine across runs.
- Only fetch or build what has changed since the last package creation, minimizing overhead.
- Allow quick iteration by avoiding full package rebuilds.
- Be explicitly intended for connected development environments, not air-gapped deploys.
- Complement existing `YOLO` mode, but be exposed via CLI flags explicitly for improved usability.
- Still perform validations to avoid introducing inconsistent package states.
This change will significantly speed up development cycles by reducing the need for repeated cluster resets and full package rebuilds, improving the developer experience when working on large or frequently changing packages.","## Decision

Introduce a `dev deploy` command that will combine the lifecycle of `package create` and `package deploy` into a single command. This command will:

- Not result in a re-usable tarball / OCI artifact
- Not have any interactive prompts
- Not require `zarf init` to be run by default (override-able with a CLI flag)
- Be able to create+deploy a package in either YOLO mode (default) or prod mode (exposed via a CLI flag)
- Only build + deploy components that _will_ be deployed (contrasting with `package create` which builds _all_ components regardless of whether they will be deployed)"

"## Context

Zarf is currently using an in-house built logging solution which in turn depends on pterm. This solution is used to output information to the end user who is using the Zarf CLI. This output is for the most part formatted with the purpose of CLI user experience. Logging function calls are done both in the CLI specific code as well as in the packages. The logging is implemented in such a way that different levels exist with different impacts and log destinations. A common pattern that is used is to call `message.Fatal` whenever an error occurs. This will output the message to STDERR while writing the actual error message to a debug log and exiting the program. Exiting the program in this manner makes unit testing difficult while also skipping proper context handling and skipping any clean-up that was intended to run before exiting the program. Some logging components like the progress bar and spinner are accessed through a shared global state that is not thread safe. The coupling to logging becomes complicated as disabling the progress bar is a challenge while multi threading these functions which access the global state resulting in complicated access patterns.","## Decision 
We will refactor the logging system in Zarf to eliminate global state and improve thread safety. Specifically:
1. Remove reliance on shared global state for logging components such as progress bars and spinners. Instead, logging components will be passed explicitly as dependencies where needed to avoid concurrency issues.
2. Replace calls to `message.Fatal` that immediately exit the program with error handling that returns errors to the caller, allowing proper cleanup and context handling. The CLI layer will then handle program termination if necessary.
3. Introduce structured logging with clearly defined log levels and destinations, separating user-facing CLI output from debug and error logs.
4. Provide the ability to enable or disable specific logging components (e.g., progress bars) dynamically and in a thread-safe manner.
5. Create interfaces or abstractions over the logging implementation to allow easier testing and mocking during unit tests.
This approach will lead to cleaner separation of concerns, improved testability, and safer concurrency in logging operations.","## Decision

I am proposing to completely refactor the logging functionality to follow a more standardized format using the newish slog interfaces. On top of that we would refactor the current internationalization by converting them to standardized errors.

* Replace the message package with a slog interface.
* Replace the lang package with static errors.
* Remove any use of `message.Fatal` and instead return errors.
* Refactor use of `message.WarnErr` to either return error or to log the error.
* Refactor existing functions that print formatted outputs to defer the printing to the CLI.
* Define a new interface for spinner and progress bar that is passed in as a function parameter.

The message package currently exports the following functions which should be replaced by its logr counterpart.

| Function | Replacement | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ZarfCommand | Info | Just formats a slice as a command. |
| Command | Info | Outputs a command with a prefix and style. |
| Debug | Debug | |
| Debugf | Debug | |
| ErrorWebf | N/A | Not used anywhere. |
| Warn | Warn | |
| Warnf | Warn | |
| WarnErr | Warn | |
| WarnErrf | Warn | |
| Fatal | N/A | Should not be used. |
| Fatalf | N/A | Should not be used. |
| Info | Info | |
| Infof | Info | |
| Success | Info | Seems to be a info log with a checkmark prefix. |
| Successf | Info | Seems to be a info log with a checkmark prefix. |
| Question | ? | Open question how to resolve this. |
| Questionf | ? | Open question how to resolve this. |
| Note | Info | Should just be an info or maybe a debug log. |
| Notef | Info | Should just be an info or maybe a debug log. |
| Title | ? | Not sure how this should be replaced as it formats with separator. |
| HeaderInfof | ? | |
| HorizontalRule | ? | |
| JSONValue | N/A | Should be replaced with a marshal. |
| Paragraph | ? | |
| Paragraphn | ? | |
| PrintDiff | ? | |
| Table | ? | Need to come up with a good syntax for functions to return output that can print as a table. |
| ColorWrap | ? | Should this be used? | 
| PrintConnectStringTable | N/A | This logic should not exist in the message package. |
| PrintCredentialTable | N/A | This logic should not exist in the message package. |
| PrintComponentCredential | N/A | This logic should not exist in the message package. |
| PrintCredentialUpdates | N/A | This logic should not exist in the message package. |
| Spinner | Interface | New Spinner interface. |
| ProgressBar | Interface | New progress bar interface. |

The majority of simple logging changes should be possible with little signature changes. Replacing the existing output with a slog interface would allow other implementations to be used. A challenge initially may be the changes to table output formatting to make it work properly. This change will require some refactoring of existing code. A requirement for the changes is that they have to improve the UX for users looking at log files. As I understand the present day the spinners will cause a new line everytime they update, resulting in a lot of bloat. A goal should be to make sure that this does not happen in the future.

Spinners and progress bars however are a bit more challenging. They need to be refactored so that they are no longer instantiated outside of the CLI code. They should instead be passed as a function parameter to each function that needs them. A good example of a project that solves the problem in a similar manner is Kind. In Kind they create a [status object from the logger](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/blob/7799e72306db315ea4f4b1cac90ff68404da4f28/pkg/internal/cli/status.go#L39) which they then [pass to where it is needed](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/blob/7799e72306db315ea4f4b1cac90ff68404da4f28/pkg/cluster/internal/create/create.go#L133). Doing so results in a single status object created which is reused where ever it is needed. A lot of inspiration can be take from how Kind deals with CLI output. While they use klog instead of slog there are a lot of similarities. They have for example a check if the output is in a terminal or not, and will disable the spinner accordingly. 

Here is a suggestion for how a thread safe spinner could be implemented with a shared logger. This also allows for parallel spinners and progress bars.

```golang
package main

import (
	""context""
	""fmt""
	""io""
	""log/slog""
	""os""
	""sync""
	""time""

	""github.com/pterm/pterm""
)

func main() {
	err := run()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}

func run() error {
	h := NewPtermHandler(os.Stderr)
	log := slog.New(h)

	log.Info(""before"")

	spinner := NewSpinner(log)
	spinner.Update(""Running some job"")
	log.Info(""after"")
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
	spinner.Update(""Doing some update"")

	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)

	spinner.Succeed()

	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)

	return nil
}

type PtermHandler struct {
	printer *pterm.MultiPrinter
	attrs   []slog.Attr
	group   string
}

func NewPtermHandler(w io.Writer) *PtermHandler {
	printer, _ := pterm.DefaultMultiPrinter.WithWriter(w).Start()
	return &PtermHandler{
		printer: printer,
	}
}

func (h *PtermHandler) Enabled(context.Context, slog.Level) bool {
	return true
}

func (h *PtermHandler) Handle(ctx context.Context, r slog.Record) error {
	l := fmt.Sprintf(""%s: %s\n"", r.Level, r.Message)
	_, err := h.printer.NewWriter().Write([]byte(l))
	return err
}

func (h *PtermHandler) WithAttrs(attrs []slog.Attr) slog.Handler {
	return &PtermHandler{
		printer: h.printer,
		attrs:   append(h.attrs, attrs...),
		group:   h.group,
	}
}

func (h *PtermHandler) WithGroup(name string) slog.Handler {
	return &PtermHandler{
		printer: h.printer,
		attrs:   h.attrs,
		group:   name,
	}
}

type Spinner struct {
	sequence    []string
	mx          sync.Mutex
	log         *slog.Logger
	printer     *pterm.MultiPrinter
	firstStatus string
	status      string
	spinner     *pterm.SpinnerPrinter
}

func NewSpinner(log *slog.Logger) *Spinner {
	h, ok := log.Handler().(*PtermHandler)
	if !ok {
		return &Spinner{
			log: log,
		}
	}
	return &Spinner{
		sequence: []string{`  ? `, `  ? `, `  ? `, `  ? `, `  ? `, `  ? `, `  ? `, `  ? `, `  ? `, `  ? `},
		log:      log,
		printer:  h.printer,
	}
}

func (s *Spinner) Update(status string) {
	s.mx.Lock()
	defer s.mx.Unlock()

	// Do not update if status is the same.
	if s.status == status {
		return
	}
	if s.firstStatus == """" {
		s.firstStatus = status
	}
	s.status = status

	// If no printer we log normally.
	if s.printer == nil {
		s.log.Info(status)
		return
	}

	// Create or update the spinner.
	if s.spinner == nil {
		spinner, _ := pterm.DefaultSpinner.WithWriter(s.printer.NewWriter()).WithSequence(s.sequence...).Start(status)
		s.spinner = spinner
		return
	}
	s.spinner.UpdateText(status)
}

func (s *Spinner) Fail() {
	s.mx.Lock()
	defer s.mx.Lock()

	if s.printer == nil {
		return
	}
	s.spinner.Fail(s.firstStatus)
}

func (s *Spinner) Succeed() {
	s.mx.Lock()
	defer s.mx.Unlock()

	if s.printer == nil {
		return
	}
	s.spinner.Success(s.firstStatus)
}
```

The work will most likely have to be split into a couple of steps.

1. Remove any use of message fatal.
2. Refactor table printing functions.
3. Replace message logging with a structured logger.
4. Replace spinner and progress bars."
"## Context

Zarf currently does not have explicit schema versions. Any schema changes are embedded into Zarf and can change with new versions. There are several examples of deprecated keys throughout Zarf's lifespan such as:

- `setVariable` deprecated in favor of `setVariables`
- `scripts` deprecated in favor of `actions`
- `group` deprecated in favor of `flavor`, however these work functionally different and cannot be automatically migrated
- `cosignKeyPath` deprecated in favor of specifying the key path at create time

Zarf has not disabled any deprecated keys thus far. On create the user is always warned when using a deprecated field, however the field still exists in the schema and functions properly. Some of the deprecated keys can be migrated automatically as the old item is a subset or directly related to it's replacement. For example, setVariable is automatically migrated to a single item list of setVariables. This migration occurs on the zarf.yaml fed into the package during package create, however the original field is not deleted from the packaged zarf.yaml because the Zarf binary used in the airgap or delivery environment is not assumed to have the new schema fields that the deprecated key was migrated to.

The release of v1 will provide an opportunity to delete deprecated features that Zarf has warned will be dropped in v1.

Creating a v1 schema will allow Zarf to establish a contract with it's user base that features will be supported long term. When a feature is deprecated in the v1 schema, it will remain usable in the schema for the lifetime of v1.","## Decision
We will introduce a formal v1 schema for Zarf as part of the v1 release to establish a stable contract with users and enable long-term support guarantees.

The v1 schema will:
- Remove features and keys previously deprecated and announced for removal in the v1 release.
- Retain deprecated features that have not been explicitly announced for removal, ensuring they remain usable and supported for the lifetime of the v1 schema.
- Provide a clear, explicit structure of supported fields and keys, improving transparency and consistency in schema validation.

We will continue to provide warnings to users when deprecated fields are used, but unlike prior practice, deprecated keys removed in v1 will no longer be supported or warned—they will be removed outright.

Automatic migration for deprecated keys that can be converted safely (e.g., setVariable to setVariables) will continue where applicable during package create, however, the packaged zarf.yaml will only contain v1 schema fields.

Future schema versions beyond v1 will follow a formal versioning approach with explicit migration paths and deprecation timelines communicated to users, thus maintaining schema clarity and upgrade safety.","## Decision

Zarf will begin having proper schema versions. A top level key, `apiVersion`, will be introduced to allow users to specify the schema. At the release of v1 the only valid user input for `apiVersion` will be v1. Zarf will not allow users to build using the v0 schema. `zarf package create` will fail if the user has deprecated keys or if `apiVersion` is missing and the user will be instructed to run the new `zarf dev migrate-schema` command. `zarf dev migrate-schema` will automatically migrate deprecated fields in the users `zarf.yaml` where possible. It will also add the apiVersion key and set it to v1.

The existing go types which comprise the Zarf schema will be moved to types/alpha and will never change. An updated copy of these types without the deprecated fields will be created in a package types/v1 and any future schema changes will affect these objects. Internally, Zarf will introduce translation functions which will take the alpha schema and return the v1 schema. From that point on, all function signatures that have a struct that is included in the Zarf schema will change from `types.structName` to `v1.structName`.

All deprecated features will cause an error on create. Deprecated features with a direct migration path will still be deployed if the package was created with schema v1, as migrations will add the non deprecated fields. If a feature does not have a direct automatic migration path (cosignKeyPath & groups) the package will fail on deploy. This will happen until the alpha schema is entirely removed from Zarf, which will happen one year after v1 is released.

At create time Zarf will package both a `zarf.yaml` and a `zarfv1.yaml`. If a `zarfv1.yaml` exists Zarf will use that. If a `zarfv1.yaml` does not exist, then Zarf will know that the package was created prior to v1 and use the regular `zarf.yaml`. If the package is deployed with v0 it will read the `zarf.yaml` as normal even if the package has a `zarfv1.yaml`. This will make it simpler to drop deprecated items with migration paths from the v1 schema while remaining backwards compatible as those deprecated items will exist in the `zarf.yaml`

When Zarf introduces new keys that they are not ready to promise long term support for they will mark them as experimental in the schema. A key is assumed to be stable if it's not experimental or deprecated.

There are several other keys Zarf will deprecate which will have automated migrations to new fields
- `.metadata.aggregateChecksum` -> `.build.aggregateChecksum`
- `.components[x].required` -> `.components[x].optional`. Optional will default to false. This is a change in behavior as currently `required` defaults to true. However, automatic migration will work since we can set optional to true on any components which do not already have required.
- Metadata fields `image`, `source`, `documentation`, `url`, `authors`, `vendors` -> will become a map of `annotations`
- `noWait` -> `wait` which will default to true. This change will happen on both `.components.[x].manifests` and `components.[x].charts`
- `yolo` -> `airgap` which will default to true
- `.components.[x].actions.[default/onAny].maxRetries` -> `.components.[x].actions.[default/onAny].retries`
- `.components.[x].actions.[default/onAny].maxTotalSeconds` -> `.components.[x].actions.[default/onAny].timeout`, which must be in a [Go recognized duration string format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
- charts will change to avoid [current confusion with keys](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/2245). Exactly one of the following fields will exist for each `components.[x].charts`.
```yaml
  helm:
    url: https://stefanprodan.github.io/podinfo
    RepoName: podinfo # replaces repoName since it's only applicable for helm repos

  git:
    url: https://stefanprodan.github.io/podinfo
    path: charts/podinfo

  oci:
    url: oci://ghcr.io/stefanprodan/charts/podinfo

  local:
   path: chart
```
- A new field called `.components.[x].healthChecks` will be introduced and will utilize [kstatus](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cli-utils/blob/master/pkg/kstatus/README.md) to wait for resources to be ready after deployment. Read [#2718](https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/issues/2718) for more detail.
- a new field `.components.[x].wait` will be introduced. It will default to true, and automatically run `healthchecks` for every object in the cluster.
- `.components.[x].extensions` will be removed in favor of `zarf dev generate bigbang`. See #2875"
