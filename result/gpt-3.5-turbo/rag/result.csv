* Currently, the images/thumbnails inside the Storefront are not making use of any lazy loading mechanism. 
* Without a third-party extension which includes something like ""lazysizes"" it is not possible to get lazy loading images.
* Native lazy loading of images is available in current browsers, see: https://caniuse.com/?search=loading","## Decision 
## Decision

* Implement native lazy loading for images by adding the `loading=""lazy""` attribute to image tags in the Storefront.
* This approach avoids the need for third-party extensions and leverages built-in browser support for improved performance.
* Ensure compatibility by applying native lazy loading only to browsers that support it, while serving standard images to unsupported browsers.
* Gradually update the Storefront templates to include the `loading=""lazy""` attribute on all applicable image and thumbnail elements.","## Decision

* We want to make use of native lazy loading for images in the Storefront without adding additional JavaScript logic."
"## Context

When using the `OneToOneAssociationField` & `ManyToOneAssociationField` associations it is possible to specify the parameter `autoload` as `true`. This causes the association to be loaded with every query, regardless of whether the data is used or not.

This is a performance issue due to unnecessary data transfer, it slows down SQL queries with extra joins, slows the application down with hydrating and data processing and finally, API payloads are larger than they need to be.","## Decision 
## Decision

To avoid unnecessary performance overhead when using `OneToOneAssociationField` and `ManyToOneAssociationField` with `autoload` set to `true`, we will deprecate and eventually remove the `autoload` parameter.

Instead, we will encourage the usage of explicit association loading through criteria by:

- Requiring developers to specify associations to be loaded explicitly in their queries or repositories.
- Promoting best practices that avoid default eager loading unless it is clearly justified by use cases.

This approach ensures that data fetching is always intentional, minimizing unnecessary SQL joins, reducing the amount of data processed and transferred, and optimizing overall application performance.","## Decision

We will deprecate the usage of autoload === true in the core codebase in version 6.5. All usages in entity definitions should be removed by the time 6.6 is released.

We have introduced a new PHPStan rule which will check for any usages of autoload === true and fail if it finds any. The failures are currently ignored in the `phpstan.neon.dist` file until they can be fixed by the respective teams."
"## Context
Currently, our ADRs are grouped into folders according to different areas. We have added this structure to help people find their way around when they are looking for specific ADRs.

However, there are different approaches when searching for ADRs:
1) I am looking for an ADR and I know the headline.
2) I would like to read the latest ADRs
3) I would like to see ADRs for a specific area.
4) ...

The structuring by areas is good for case 3, but not for the other two. In the first case, the user can easily use the search via the directory to use the appropriate ADR, but will also get duplicate matches. Depending on the keyword the result can be quite long.

In the second case, I would like to read the latest ADRs, the user would have to go to git history, which is only possible via shell or IDE.","## Decision 
## Decision

ADRs will continue to be stored in folders by area to support targeted browsing (case 3).

To support other common search patterns (cases 1 and 2), the tool will provide an index command that:

- Scans all ADRs across all area folders.
- Builds a unified index with metadata including headline, area, and creation date.
- Supports full-text search on headlines to locate specific ADRs (case 1).
- Supports sorting or filtering ADRs by date to easily find the latest ones (case 2).

This index will be accessible via a command-line interface and optionally as a generated file for quick reference.

This approach balances the benefits of physical folder organization with enhanced searching capabilities for other use cases.","## Decision

We will remove the area structure on directory level and introduce front matter in our ADRs as we already do in our changelog files. This makes it possible to extract metadata from content. Additionally, it can be used as groundwork, if we want to release our ADRs in different front-ends (handbook, dev-docs) and use the front-end's search functionalities.
With front matter and the flat file structure, you can solve all three problems described in this ADR. An example of this specific ADR would be:

```markdown
---
title: Unstructured ADRs
date: 2023-02-23
area: Product Operation #I added prod-ops because this is a workflow topic
tags: [ADR, file structure, workflow]
---
```

We also hope that this will make it easier for people to submit ADRs without being confused about which folder to put the file in."
"## Context
Our current plugin extension system for the administration is based on our Component Factory. This factory generates native Vue components at runtime based on a base Shopware component which can be extended or overwritten by plugins. This approach offers flexibility to plugin developers to modify every component. For the template part, we use Twig.JS and compile the Vue template in the client at runtime.

However, this approach has its drawbacks. We cannot use the full power of Vue and its ecosystem because everything related to Vue is wrapped with our factories and generated at runtime. We cannot use Vue tools without custom modifications, like linting template files, providing good static analysis, and more. The other downside is that upgrading Vue is challenging, and the performance suffers because we cannot precompile components.

To address these issues, we aimed to test a new idea with Vue 3, which includes all the features of the existing plugin approach, but developed using only native Vue tools. This would offer several benefits, like using the full power of Vue, better performance, better static analysis, and more.

Our main idea for the template part was to use native Vue components named sw-block that can replace the Twig.JS template part. Plugin developers can extend or overwrite the sw-block component as needed.

```html
<sw-block name=""sw-hello-world"">
<div>Hello World</div>
</sw-block>
```

For the script and logic part, we aimed to use the Composition API. Before returning all the component data and methods, we would provide a hook point for plugins so they could modify or inject everything they want.

```js
// The original component
<script setup lang=""ts"">
// Hook for providing extensibility
useExtensibility();
</script>

// The plugin component
<script lang=""ts"">
    import SwOrignal from './sw-original.vue';
    // use our extensibility helpers
    import { useComponentExtender, getPropsFromComponent } from 'sw-vue-extensbiles';
    
    const myCustomData = ref('test');
    
    export default {
        name: 'sw-extended-component',
        props: {
            ...getPropsFromComponent(SwOrignal)
        },
        setup(props, context) {
            return {
                ...useComponentExtender(SwOrignal, props, context),
                myCustomData
            }   
        }
}
</script>
```

However, during the evaluation and testing, we realized that this approach was not feasible due to several reasons. The most critical challenges were that it was hard to merge data because the Vue compiler optimizes many parts of the component, and it was not easy to pass all the data of the component to the block system to give plugin developers full access to the original component's data.

To solve these problems, we would need to use internal Vue logic, which is not update-safe and could break with every Vue update.","## Decision 
## Decision
We decided not to replace our current Component Factory based plugin extension system with the new native Vue 3-based approach using sw-block components and the Composition API extensibility hooks.

Although the new approach offers better performance, tooling, and leverage of Vue’s ecosystem, the technical challenges around merging component data and exposing all component internals to plugins proved to be insurmountable without relying on internal Vue APIs, which are not stable.

Therefore, we will continue using our existing Component Factory system despite its shortcomings in tooling and upgrade complexity. We will revisit this decision if future Vue versions provide official, stable APIs enabling safe extensibility and data merging without hacks. Meanwhile, we will evaluate incremental improvements to our current approach to improve developer experience and maintainability.","## Decision
After considering the challenges we faced with the proposed solution, we concluded that we couldn't find solutions without using internal Vue logic. Given this situation, we did not see any significant benefits to adopting a native Vue solution over our current plugin system, which, despite its challenges, has proven to work well for our use case.

Therefore, we decided to stick with our current plugin system for the administration until new possibilities arise in Vue that solve our problems."
"## Context
The current workflow for writing technical changelog is not very suited for a trunk based development and branching process. There are some major issues with the current workflow of using one file with a fixed version number:

*  Unnecessary merge conflicts in the changelog file
*  Uncertainty about the correct release version of the change
*  Differences between the issue state in Jira and the code state

To tackle these issues the technique for writing technical changelog and upgrade information, should be changed to a single solution, which is easy to understand and maintain by developers.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will switch to a changelog management strategy that uses separate changelog fragments for each change, instead of a single changelog file with a fixed version number. Each changelog fragment is a small file containing details about an individual change, which can be reviewed and merged independently.

Advantages of this approach include:

* Minimizes merge conflicts since changes are isolated in separate files
* Avoids uncertainty about release version since versioning is handled at release time
* Keeps the changelog in sync with the code and issue tracker state
* Simplifies maintenance and contribution by developers

The fragments will be later combined automatically into a consolidated changelog during the release process, ensuring coherent, complete, and up-to-date release notes.

This approach aligns with trunk-based development workflows and improves clarity and traceability in changelog management.","## Decision
The changelog and upgrade files for a release should be autogenerated in the build process of the release. Developers should write technical changelog and upgrade information in separate markdown files."
"## Context

The actions in Flow Builder are listening for Business Events. We want to implement the flow DelayAction in Flow Builder,
that means the actions can be delayed, and will be executed after  a set amount of time.
But we have some problems after the action was delayed:
* Events may contain old data, that data may be updated during the delay, and currently we don't have any way to restore
    the data.
* After a delay the rules have to be re-evaluated, but the data in the rules could be outdated or changed, so the rules
    have to be reloaded as well. Or the rules do not exist anymore.","## Decision 
## Decision

To address the challenges with the DelayAction in Flow Builder, we will adopt the following approach:

- When an action is delayed, we do **not** persist the event data as-is for later usage, because it may become outdated.
- Instead, after the delay period ends, we will **re-fetch the necessary data** required for rule evaluation and action execution, ensuring the most current state.
- To enable this, the delayed execution will store only **minimal references or identifiers** necessary to retrieve fresh data at execution time.
- Prior to executing delayed actions, rules will be **reloaded and re-evaluated dynamically** against the latest data, handling cases where rules might have changed or been removed.
- If a rule no longer exists or cannot be evaluated, the corresponding delayed action will be skipped or handled accordingly, to maintain consistency.
- This approach ensures that delayed actions operate on up-to-date data and rules, avoiding issues stemming from stale or invalidated event information during the delay.","## Decision

We would need to detach the Event System and the Flow System from each other, thus removing the dependency on the runtime objects within an event.
Meaning the Actions must not have access to the original Events.

We would create a class `StorableFlow`, that can store the data in the original event as scalar values, and restore the original data based on this stored data.
```php
class StorableFlow
{
    // contains the scalar values based on the original events
    // $store can be serialized and used to restore the object data
    protected array $store = [];
    
    // contains the restored object data like the data we defined in the `availableData` in original events 
    // $data can not be serialized, but can be restored from $store
    protected array $data = [];
      
    public function __construct(array $store = [], array $data = [])
    {
        $this->store = $store;
        $this->data = $data;
    }
    
    // This method will be called in each `Storer` to store the representation of data
    public function setStore(string $key, $value) {
        $this->store[$key] = $value;
    }
    
    public function getStore(string $key) {
        return $this->store[$key];
    }
    
    // After we restored the data in `Storer`, we can set the data, we'll use `$this->data` instead getter data on original event
    public function setData(string $key, $value) {
        $this->data[$key] = $value;
    }
    
    public function getData(string $key) {
        return $this->data[$key];
    }
}
```

The `StorableFlow` class will be use on Flow Builder:

Before:

```php
class FlowDispatcher 
{
    public function dispatch(Event $event) {
        ...
        // Currently, dispatch on Flow Builder use the original event to execute the Flow 
        $this->callFlowExecutor($event);
        ...
    }
}
```

After:

```php
class FlowDispatcher 
{
    public function dispatch(Event $event) {
        ...
        // The `FlowFactory` will create/restore the `StorableFlow` from original event
        $flow = $this->flowFactory->create($event);
        // use the `StorableFlow` to execute the flow builder actions instead of the original events
        $this->execute($flow);
        ...
    }
}
```

* Flow Builder actions may no longer access the original event.
* Each Aware Interface gets its own `Storer` class to restore the data of Aware, so we have many `Storer` like `OrderStorer`, `MailStorer`, `CustomerStorer` ...
* The main task of a `Storer` is to restore the data from a scalar storage.
* The `Storer` provides a store function, in order to store itself the data, in order restore the object
* The `Storer` provides a restore function to restore the object using the store data.

```php
interface FlowStorer {}
```
Example for `OrderStorer`:

```php
class OrderStorer implements FlowStorer
{
    // This function to check the original event is the instanceof Aware interface, and store the representation.
    public function store(FlowEventAware $event, array $storedData): array 
    {
        if ($event instanceof OrderAware) {
            $storedData['orderId'] = $event->getOrderId();
        }
        
        return $storedData;
    }
    
    // This function is restore the data based on representation in `storedData`
    public function restore(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {
        if ($flow->hasStore('orderId')) {
            // allows to provide a closure for lazy data loading
            // this opens the opportunity to have lazy loading for big data
            // When we load the entity, we need to add the necessary associations for each entity
            $flow->lazy('order', [$this, 'load']);    
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

About the additional data defined in `availableData` in original events, that aren't defined in any Aware Interfaces and we can't restore that data in the `Storer`.
To cover the additional data from original events, we will have another `store` `AdditionalStorer` to store those data.
```php
class AdditionalStorer extends FlowStorer
{
    public function store(FlowEventAware $event, array $storedData)
    {
        ...
        // based on the `getAvailableData` in the original event to get the type of additional data
        $additionalDataTypes = $event::getAvailableData()->toArray();
        
        foreach ($additionalDataTypes as $key => $eventData) {
            // Check if the type of data is Entity or EntityCollection
            // in the $storedData, we only store the presentation like ['id' => id, 'entity' => entity], we'll restore the data in `AdditionalStorer::restore`
            if ($eventData['type'] === 'Entity' || 'EntityCollection') {
                $storedData[$key] = [
                    'id' => $event->getId(),
                    'entity' => Entity                 
                ];
            }
            
            // Check if the type of data is ScalarValueType
            if ($eventData['type'] === ScalarValueType) {
                $storedData[$key] = value
            }
            
            // start to implement /Serializable for ObjectType
            if ($eventData['type'] === ObjectType) {
                $storedData[$key] = value->serialize()
            }
            
            ...
        }
        
        ... 
        
        return $storedData;
    }
      
    // this function  make sure we can restore the additional data from original data are not covered in `Storer`
    // The additional data can be other entity, because the entities we defined in Aware interface like `order`, `customer` ... covered be `Storer`
    public function restore(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {
        if (type === entity) {
            // About the associations for entity data, mostly the additional entity data is the base entity, we don't need to add associations for this
            $flow->setData($key, $this->load());
        } else {
            $flow->setData($key, $flow->getStore($key));
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

About the associations for entity data, mostly the additional entity data is the base entity, we don't need to add associations for this.
About the `ObjectType` data, we enforce all values used in ObjectType implement /Serializable, and serialize the object before store to `$storedData`.

* Flow Builder actions only work with the `StorableFlow` instead of the `FlowEvent`. The `StorableFlow` will restore the data from original events via `Storer`,
  and the Actions can get the data via `getData($key)` from `StorableFlow` instead of `getAvailableData` from original events.

Before, in the flow actions still dependency Aware interfaces:

```php
    public function handle(StorableFlow $event) {
        ...
        $baseEvent = $event->getEvent();
    
        if ($baseEvent instanceof CustomerAware) {
            $customerId= $baseEvent->getCustomerId();
        }
        ...
    }
```
After in the flow actions:
```php
    public function handle(StorableFlow $event) {
        ...
        if ($event->hasStore('customerId') {
            $customerId= $event->getStore('customerId');
        }
        ...
    }
```

* `getAvailableData` must NOT be responsible for the access of the data.
* To create new or restore the `StorableFlow` by on the existing stored data, we need to provider the `FlowFactory`.
```php
class FlowFactory
{    
    ...
    public function create(FlowEventAware $event)
    {
        $storedData = [];
        foreach ($this->storer as $storer) {
            // Storer are responsible to move the corresponding 
            // data from the original event 
            $storer->store($event, $storedData);
        }
        
        return $this->restore($storedData);
    }
  
    public function restore(array $stored = [], array $data = [])
    {
        $flow = new StorableFlow($stored, $data);
      
        foreach ($this->storer as $storer) {
            $storer->restore($flow);
        }
  
        return $flow;
    }
    ...
}
```
But when executing a delayed actions, we won't have a `StorableFlow`, we just have the `$stored` from the previously stored `StorableFlow`,
and based on the `$stored`, we can restore a new `StorableFlow`.

Example in Delay Actions:

```php
// In handler delay actions -> put the actions to `queue`
$stored = json_encode($flow->stored());

$connection->executeStatement('INSERT INTO `swag_delay_action` (store) VALUES (:stored)...', ['stored' => $stored]);
```

```php
// In handler execute delay actions
$stored = 'SELECT store FROM `swag_delay_action` .... ';

$flow = $this->flowFactory->restore(json_decode($stored));
```"
"## Context

We need a different extension mechanism besides the well known plugins, that works in cloud and on-prem environments in the same way.
That's why we envisioned the app system, currently publicly available as a [plugin](https://github.com/shopware/app-system).
We were able to quickly develop the app system, gather feedback and iterate over ideas without being bound to the strict release workflow of the shopware platform.
That was the reason why we started working on the app system as a plugin in the first place.

Now as the app system matured, it is time to integrate the app system back into the platform.
This has the following benefits:
* It sends the signal to partners and potential app manufacturers that the app system is stable
* Partners / app manufacturers can rely on the shopware 6 release cycle and the according upgrade process
* Users don't need to install an extra plugin in order to use apps","## Decision 
## Decision

We will integrate the app system directly into the Shopware platform core.

- The app system will no longer be a standalone plugin, but part of the platform's core codebase.
- This integration will align the app system's release cycle with Shopware's main release cycle.
- Partners and app manufacturers will treat the app system as stable and reliable because it is maintained and released alongside the core platform.
- Users will no longer need to install a separate plugin to use apps, simplifying the user experience.
- The development and maintenance of the app system will be consolidated, reducing overhead and improving consistency.
- Migration steps and documentation will be provided for existing users of the app system plugin to ease the transition.","## Decision

We will migrate the existing app system from the [plugin](https://github.com/shopware/app-system) into the platform. The app system will be part of the core bundle, analogous to the plugin system.
It will be moved to the `Shopware\Core\Framework\App` namespace."
"## Context
At the moment we have a bunch of different `FlowStorer` implementations. Most of them are used to store scalar values without any restore logic. Each of the Storer class has an own interface which is used to identify if the data of the event should be stored. This leads to much boilerplate code when adding new storer implementations or when plugins want to bypass some for events.","## Decision 
## Decision

To reduce boilerplate and improve extensibility, we will unify the existing `FlowStorer` implementations into a single generic interface with optional restore logic. 

Key decisions:
- Define a common `FlowStorer` interface with methods to `Store(event Event) error` and `Restore() error`.
- Provide a base abstract struct implementing default no-op restore logic, allowing implementations to override if needed.
- Allow plugins to easily bypass or extend specific storers by implementing this unified interface.
- Reduce the proliferation of separate interfaces to identify event storage eligibility by moving this responsibility into the unified `FlowStorer` implementations.
- Refactor existing implementations to conform to the new interface, eliminating redundant code and simplifying the addition of new storers.

This will streamline event data storage, promote code reuse, and provide clear extension points for plugins requiring custom behavior.","## Decision

We introduce a generic `ScalarValuesAware` interface which can be used to store simple values which should be simply stored and restored one to one:

```php
interface ScalarValuesAware
{
    public const STORE_VALUES = 'scalar_values';
    
    /** @return array<string, scalar|null|array> */
    public function getValues(): array;
}
```

This event can be used in different events which needs a simple storage logic:

```php
class SomeFlowAwareEvent extends Event implements ScalarStoreAware, FlowEventAware
{
    public function __construct(private readonly string $url) { }

    public function getValues(): array
    {
        return ['url' => $this->url];
    }
}
```

To store and restore this data, we provide a simple `FlowStorer` implementation:

```php

class ScalarValuesStorer extends FlowStorer
{
    public function store(FlowEventAware $event, array $stored): array
    {
        if (!$event instanceof ScalarValuesAware) return $stored

        $stored[ScalarValuesAware::STORE_VALUES] = $event->getValues();

        return $stored;
    }

    public function restore(StorableFlow $storable): void
    {
        $values = $storable->getStore(ScalarValuesAware::STORE_VALUES);
        foreach ($values as $key => $value) {
            $storable->setData($key, $value);
        }
    }
}
```"

The current sw-text-editor in the administration has numerous low-level bugs in basic WYSIWYG features. It is built in a
way that is difficult to maintain and understand. Therefore, we require a new text editor that is easy to maintain, has
a good feature set, is flexible to extend and more stable.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will replace the current sw-text-editor with a new, maintainable text editor component that offers a robust WYSIWYG feature set. The new editor will be chosen based on its ease of maintenance, flexibility for extension, and stability to reduce low-level bugs. This will improve developer experience and provide a better, more reliable editing tool for the administration.","## Decision
Building a new text editor from scratch is not a viable option. Therefore, we have evaluated various existing text 
editors and narrowed down our options to the following:

    - CKEditor 5
    - TinyMCE
    - QuillJS
    - Prosemirror
    - TipTap V2
    - Lexical

We have decided to skip CKEditor 5 and TinyMCE because they require a license for our use case and are not 100% open
source. Prosemirror was also ruled out because it provides only a low-level API and requires much more implementation 
time than the other editors. Additionally, Lexical is not a valid option for us since it is specialized for React 
environments and has no official support for VueJS.

The remaining two editors are TipTap V2 and QuillJS. Both have similar feature sets and APIs, but we have found some 
major differences between them. The first difference is that TipTap is a headless editor, which means that it only
provides the editor logic and requires a UI implementation. QuillJS, on the other hand, is a fully featured editor that
provides a UI out of the box. In our case, it is better to use a headless editor like TipTap because we can implement 
the UI to fit our needs, especially for several edge cases that are hard to implement in QuillJS.

The second major difference is in extensibility. TipTap's API is more flexible, allowing us to implement our own
features using the existing TipTap and ProseMirror plugins or build our own plugins. In most cases, the powerful main
TipTap API can already solve most of our use cases. QuillJS, on the other hand, is not as flexible as TipTap, and its
extension system is more complicated to use.

The third big difference is in stability. We found that TipTap is more stable than QuillJS, probably because TipTap is 
built on top of ProseMirror, which is a very stable and well-tested editor. Although QuillJS is also generally stable,
other developers have reported some issues with it in the past.

Our main decision driver was the extensibility of the editor. We want a text editor that is easy to extend and allows us
to implement our own features. TipTap provides a powerful extension system that is easy to use, and we can implement our
design without overwriting an existing design of other editors. Therefore, we have decided to use TipTap as the base of
our new text editor."

This change promotes inclusivity and provides a clear, consistent default value
for unspecified salutations across the platform.","## Decision
We have modified the existing salutation handling in Shopware 6 to update the default value to ""not_specified"" when the salutation is null. This decision was made based on the following considerations:

* Inclusivity: By offering a default salutation of ""not_specified"" for null values, we promote inclusivity and ensure that all customers are appropriately addressed, even when salutation data is missing.
* Customer Experience: Providing a default salutation ensures consistency in customer communications and prevents any confusion or misinterpretation when a salutation is not explicitly specified.
* Non-Deletable Default Salutation: It has been decided that the ""not_specified"" salutation, being the default value for unspecified salutations, should not be deletable by the shop owner. This ensures that there is always a fallback option available, guaranteeing a consistent experience for customers."

The storefront CSS, compiled by `scssphp/scssphp`, is currently automatically prefixed with vendor prefixes using `padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer`.
However, the generated prefixes no longer add much value since the browser support has been updated with the Bootstrap v5 update.
Most of the prefixes are unnecessary for the supported browsers in .browserslist.
Unfortunately, the `theme:compile` process experiences a significant decrease in performance due to the auto-prefixer, which is particularly problematic in our SaaS solution.
Moreover, the `padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer` package does not work dynamically and fails to consider `.browserslist` while applying the appropriate vendor-prefixes.
This package hard-codes the CSS properties that require prefixing, making it an unsustainable long-term solution.
To demonstrate this, a table containing all automatic prefixes generated by `padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer` is provided below.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will remove the usage of `padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer` from the storefront SCSS compilation process.

Rationale:
* The autoprefixer package does not respect the `.browserslist` configuration, therefore applying many unnecessary vendor prefixes.
* Most of the required vendor prefixes are obsolete given our updated browser support with Bootstrap v5.
* The autoprefixer causes a significant performance penalty during theme compilation, which is unacceptable especially for our SaaS environment.
* The package is not actively maintained and relies on a hardcoded list of properties, making it unsustainable and prone to generating incorrect prefixes over time.

Outcome:
* The theme compilation process will be faster and more efficient.
* Output CSS will exclude superfluous vendor prefixes, reducing CSS size.
* We can rely on modern browser compatibility and `.browserslist` configuration for vendor prefixing.
* If dynamic vendor prefixing is needed in future, we will evaluate better-supported tools or integrate client-side solutions.

Overall, removing this outdated autoprefixer aligns with modern frontend best practices and improves build performance.","## Decision

* Due to the above points we have decided to disable the CSS auto-prefixing by default.
* In case it is still needed, to support older browsers or some special CSS property from the table above, it can still be activated via the config key `storefront.theme.auto_prefix_css` in `Storefront/Resources/config/packages/storefront.yaml`. However, we recommend to do a manual prefix inside the SCSS instead.
* We will deprecate the auto-prefixing for v6.6.0 and only use SCSS compiling
* We do not consider the deactivation of the auto-prefixing as a hard breaking change because:
    * Most prefixes are not needed due to current browser support.
    * Some prefixes are for CSS properties which are no longer implemented and developed by browsers.
    * Prefixes which are still valid are primarily cosmetic/appearance properties which are very unlikely to affect the Storefronts functionality."

A pre-release package version is a version followed by a hyphen and an alphanumeric string.

Imagine the following scenario:
* An imaginary package is marked as insecure with version 1.8.7
* The issue is fixed with 2.0.0
* We use version `1.9.0-alpha1`
* Any pre-release package version like `1.9.0-alpha1` is interpreted as `<0.0.0` by npm

Why is this problematic?

The insecurity introduced with version `1.8.7` would never get reported to us by npm, unless we switch to a none pre-release version.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will avoid using pre-release package versions (versions with a hyphen and alphanumeric suffix such as `1.9.0-alpha1`) in version streams where security vulnerabilities have been reported in prior stable versions but fixed in subsequent stable releases.

Because npm treats all pre-release versions as lower than `0.0.0`, vulnerabilities fixed in versions like `2.0.0` will not be flagged correctly if pre-release versions such as `1.9.0-alpha1` are installed.

To ensure vulnerability reports are accurately received and security issues addressed, we will:

- Use only stable version numbers for package releases that need to receive security advisories or vulnerability monitoring via npm.
- Limit the use of pre-release versions to experimental or early access builds that do not replace or supersede vulnerable stable versions.
- Communicate clearly to developers about the implications of using pre-release versions with respect to npm vulnerability detection.

This approach will help maintain security visibility and ensure proper dependency management in all environments.","## Decision
Using pre-release package versions is prohibited.
This will be checked via a npm `preinstall` script."

The existing SQL snippet to delete the outdated cart entries doesn't use any database index to narrow down entries that can be deleted. 
On high traffic shops this leads to SQL query times larger than 30 seconds to find and remove these database entries.

Running 
```
EXPLAIN DELETE FROM cart
WHERE (updated_at IS NULL AND created_at <= '2023-02-01')
   OR (updated_at IS NOT NULL AND updated_at <= '2023-02-01') LIMIT 1000;
```
shows that the original sql query doesn't use an index (`possible_keys` = `NULL`)","## Decision 
## Decision

To optimize the deletion of outdated cart entries and avoid long query execution times under high traffic, we will implement the following changes:

1. **Add appropriate database indexes**:  
   - Create an index on the `created_at` column to optimize the condition `created_at <= 'date'`.  
   - Create an index on the `updated_at` column to optimize the condition `updated_at <= 'date'`.  
   Possibly combined indexes may be considered if beneficial.

2. **Rewrite the delete query to leverage these indexes**:  
   - Ensure that the SQL WHERE clause conditions use the indexed columns without functions or expressions that would prevent index usage.  
   - Avoid conditions like `updated_at IS NULL` that may avoid index usage; consider alternatives if possible.

3. **Implement batch deletion with a LIMIT clause**:  
   - Delete in smaller batches (e.g., LIMIT 1000) to reduce lock contention and avoid long-running transactions.

4. **Regular maintenance and monitoring**:  
   - Schedule periodic deletions to avoid accumulation of outdated entries.  
   - Monitor query performance and adjust indexes as needed.

This approach will ensure efficient deletion operations by utilizing database indexes, thereby significantly reducing query execution times and avoiding bottlenecks under high traffic conditions.","## Decision

Reorder the query parameters so that the relevant cart entries can be narrowed down by an indexed field.

Currently, it is hard to publish features in an early state to gather feedback regarding those features. If they are useful, what needs to be improved etc.
One major reason is that everything we publish (that is not marked as internal) is part of our backwards compatibility promise, thus changing foundational parts of features is quite hard after first release.
That leads to features being developed over quite some time without getting actual feedback from users or being able to release them, as they need to be implemented to a pretty final state in order to confidently release them in a stable manner, where we will keep backwards compatibility.

This at the same time also means that the current approach is not beneficial to our ecosystem, whom the whole backwards compatibility promise should benefit, because the features are built behind closed curtains they can't chime in with ideas and use cases regarding extendability, etc.

Examples of features that could benefit from an earlier experimental release:
* B2B:
  * We could release the multi account B2B feature with a ""simple"" employee management system first, and then add the more complex budget management or access control on top of that later.
* Advanced Search:
  * We could release a first version of the new advanced search feature, without all configuration options and customizability that we might envision.

In both cases, releasing the first increments of the features without an ""experimental""-flag would mean that we would have to keep backwards compatibility for the whole feature, even if we later decide to change the implementation of the feature, thus making the development of the feature harder.
Also in getting feedback from the customers what additional functionalities are needed after we released the first foundational increment of the feature, we can base our further prioritization on real customer feedback.
Thus, we can ship business value sooner to our customers and lower the risk of building the wrong thing.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will introduce an ""experimental"" release channel or feature flag system for early-stage features.

- Features released as experimental will not be subject to the full backwards compatibility guarantees.
- This allows teams to release incomplete or evolving features to gather early feedback from users and customers.
- Experimental features can be iterated on rapidly, including breaking changes, without risking compatibility issues.
- Once a feature matures and stabilizes based on user feedback, it can be promoted out of the experimental state and treated as part of the stable API with full backwards compatibility.
- This approach encourages early user involvement, enabling prioritization and improvement driven by real feedback.
- It reduces development risk by shipping incremental business value sooner and avoiding premature commitment to final implementations.","## Decision

To ship features earlier, we add the concept of ""experimental"" features, thus giving early access to meaningful increments of features that are still in active development.
That means in particular that there is no backwards compatibility promise for experimental features, thus we can change the implementation as is needed, without having to worry about breaking changes.
We mark the code for those features with a new `experimental` annotation, to make it clear on code level that the API is **not yet** stable.
For code where already expect that it should never become part of the public API we will use the `@internal` annotation directly, to make sure that even if the feature is stable we will continue to tread those parts of the code as internal and not keep backwards compatible.
Everything that is marked with `@experimental` is designed to be part of the public API, when the feature is stable.

At the same time, it offers a way for the ecosystem to give early feedback on the feature, as well as to test it in their own projects. Especially, extension developers can check how they might want to integrate and extend the feature being built, and thus suggest the needed extension points during the development process.
To make this possible that means that there also will be documentation (API docs, dev docs and user docs) for experimental features

All experimental features are developed with a specific target version, beginning with that version, the feature is considered stable, and the APIs will be kept backwards compatible.
This means that `experimental` annotation/attribute have to be removed, before the version can be released. Because it is hard to estimate exactly with which release a feature may be stable (as it also depends on the feedback we get) it makes sense to mark them as being stable with the next major version.
That does not mean that the feature won't be finished and stable earlier (we can remove the experimental status with any minor version), it only means that at the latest with that version it is considered stable, this prevents a situation where a lot of features stay in the experimental state for a long time."

The stock handling in Shopware 6 is currently not very flexible and does not support many common use cases. 

* It's not possible to easily replace the loading of stocks with a custom implementation, for example one that communicates with an ERP.
* It's not possible to easily modify how stock is increased/decreased throughout the order lifecycle.
* Available stock calculation is very slow on large catalogs.
* Stock is stored as two distinct values: stock and available stock. This is due to the fact that stock is not reduced until an order is set as completed. Therefore, the available stock is calculated as the stock minus all open orders. This is unnecessarily complex.","## Decision 
## Decision

- Introduce a new extensible stock management service that allows for:
  - Custom stock loading and synchronization mechanisms to be injected, supporting external systems such as ERPs.
  - Customizable stock adjustment logic during different stages of the order lifecycle through event hooks or strategy patterns.
- Optimize available stock calculation by:
  - Employing caching strategies or database optimizations to improve performance on large product catalogs.
  - Simplifying the stock model by eliminating the dual storage of stock and available stock, instead maintaining a single source of truth and computing availability dynamically.
- Provide clear APIs and extension points so that plugins or custom implementations can override core stock behavior without modifying core code.","## Decision

We have only one field `stock` in the product definition which always has a real time calculated value.

The `stock` value should be correctly updated as an order and its line items transition through the various states. Eg, stock is decremented when an order is placed. If it is cancelled, the stock is increased, and so on.

We have a clear API for manipulating stock which can be extended and supports arbitrary data, which could, for example, support features such as multi warehouse inventory.

We have a way to disable the stock handling behavior of Shopware."

By default, every exception that is thrown in the PHP stack and not caught will be logged by the `symfony/monolog-bridge` on `error` level.
But there are some cases where the exception is caused by clients accessing the API wrong (missing fields etc.) and throwing an `ShopwareHttpException` with an HTTP-Status-Code of 40x is our way of handling such situations and returning a correct HTTP-Status-Code to the client.
So those cases are in fact no ""errors"" that need to be analyzed, but are expected given a malformed API request.
Logging those cases as ""errors"" produces a lot of noise, which makes it harder to actually find errors in the logs.

For our cloud product, we already used a configuration list that configures that some Exception classes should only be logged as notices.","## Decision 
## Decision

To reduce log noise caused by client-caused exceptions (such as `ShopwareHttpException` with 4xx HTTP status codes), configure the logging system to downgrade these exceptions from ""error"" level to ""notice"" level.

This approach ensures:

- Expected client errors (bad requests, missing fields) do not clutter error logs.
- Real errors remain prominently logged for analysis.
- Existing configuration lists can be used to specify exception classes that should be logged at a lower level.

Implement this filtering in the logging configuration (e.g., Monolog) to classify exceptions accordingly.","## Decision

We add a configuration to the platform that degrades the error level of specific exceptions to notices. This way, external hosters can also profit from our classification.
We use [symfony's `exceptions` configuration](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/framework.html#exceptions) for this.

This has the benefit that for specific projects this configuration could be adjusted, for example, for cases where you also control all clients that access the shop, you may want to log also every client error, just to help debugging the client.

Another solution could be to do the configuration of the log level directly in the exception class either by attributes or a separate method specifying the log level, but that would make overwriting it for a specific project harder, so we stick to the default symfony configuration."

Using UUIDs as primary keys eases the integration of several different data sources,
but it also brings some performance issues.

Currently, we're using UUIDv4, which is a random UUID the completely random prefix means
that the B-tree indexes of the database are not very efficient.

UUIDv7 time-based prefix is less spread than that of UUIDv4, this helps the database to keep the index more compact.
It allows the Index to allocate fewer new pages and to keep the index smaller.","## Decision 
## Decision

We decide to migrate from UUIDv4 to UUIDv7 as the preferred format for primary keys. UUIDv7 includes a time-based prefix which improves database index efficiency by reducing index fragmentation. This change leads to more compact B-tree indexes, less frequent page allocations, and generally better database performance while maintaining the benefits of UUIDs for uniqueness and ease of integrating multiple data sources.","## Decision

Considering there is little risk to using UUIDv7, as v4 and v7 share the same
length and are indistinguishable for shopware, we can switch to v7 without any risk
of breaking anything.

The effort is also very low as we only need to change the
implementation of the `Uuid` class. As using UUIDv7 will improve the speed of
bulk product inserts by about 8 %, we think the effort is worth the measurable and
theoretical gain."

Allow apps to extend the list of available events in the flow builder by introducing a plugin-based event registration system. This system will:

- Provide a clear API for apps and third-party plugins to register new event types along with their associated metadata.
- Ensure that newly registered events are discoverable and usable within the flow builder interface.
- Maintain backward compatibility by preserving existing events and their behaviors.
- Validate event definitions on registration to prevent conflicts and ensure consistency across the system.

Right now only Shopware Backend is able to communicate with the App Server in a secure way.
This is because the App Server is able to verify the origin of the request by checking request signature, 
and this signature is generated by the Shopware 6 backend application with a shop to app server secret.

When an app wants to communicate directly with the App Server,
the App Server is not able to verify the origin of the request and has to trust the client.
This works fine for public available data, but not when you reliably need the logged-in customer and other information.","## Decision 
## Decision

To enable secure direct communication between apps and the App Server, each app must be issued a unique, secret key that allows the App Server to verify the origin of requests.

* The Shopware backend will generate and provide this secret to each installed app securely.
* Apps must use the secret to sign their requests to the App Server.
* The App Server will verify the request signature using the stored secret before processing any request that requires authorization or sensitive data.
* For public data, requests may not require signature verification.
* This approach ensures mutual trust and secure communication, allowing apps to reliably identify logged-in customers and access protected information without depending solely on the Shopware backend.","## Decision

We provide a new endpoint `/store-api/app-system/{appName}/generate-token` (`/app-system/{appName}/generate-token` in Storefront) which generates a JWT token for the given app.
This endpoint requires that the customer is logged-in and the app is installed and active. 

The JWT token contains claims like:
- `iat` - issued at
- `exp` - expiration time
- `shopId` - the shop id of the current shop
- `salesChannelId` - the sales channel id of the current sales channel
- `customerId` - the customer id of the logged-in customer
- `cartToken` - the cart token of the current cart

The additional claims are bound to app permissions when an app does not have permissions to read a customer,
it does not get the `customerId` claim.

The JWT token is signed with the shop to app server secret key which we use already for the signature.
So the App Server needs to be able to verify the JWT key and use the claims in a secure way.
The request body of the client is still untrusted and has to be properly validated by the app server.

The request cycle would look like this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Shopware Backend
    participant App Server
    Client->>Shopware Backend: GET /store-api/app-system/TestApp/generate-token
    Shopware Backend->>Client: Responds with Signed JWT Token
    Client->>App Server: Post /product-review/submit containing JWT in header
```

The JWT token is valid for 15 minutes and can be used multiple times until expired.
The client should save it in the [session storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)
and request it only on expiry again.
Additionally, the API route should be rate limited to not generate too often an expensive JWT key."

In the past merchants had to deal with issues where their custom-built flow did not
behave how they intended it to do. An concrete example: We've had a merchant that contacted
us (shopware) that their shop did not sent out mails. Debugging the flow turned out to
be harder than we thought and honestly harder than it should be. The flow builder should
empower users to build reliable flows and not spend their precious time trying to
figure out what went wrong.

To improve the experience when using the Flow Builder were taking measures. First,
Flow Builder Preview and second Flow Builder Logging. This ADR only discusses the former one,
there are plans internally for the latter one, but it won't get much attention for now, as
it also addresses different issues (what does my flow do vs what went wrong in the past).

Users should be able to preview a flow and get further understanding on how a flow executes.

execute / simulate the real flow","## Decision 
## Decision

We will implement a Flow Builder Preview feature that allows users to visually preview the execution path of their flow within the Flow Builder interface without actually executing or simulating the real actions.

This preview will:

* Display the steps and decisions inside the flow clearly to improve user understanding.
* Help users validate the logical structure and correctness of their flow.
* Enable identifying potential logical issues or unexpected behavior before deployment.
* Provide an immediate and interactive way to explore flow execution paths without side effects or external dependencies.

This approach empowers merchants by making flow behavior transparent and debuggable, reducing time spent troubleshooting flow issues like missed emails, and enhancing their confidence in building reliable custom flows. The Flow Builder Logging feature will be considered later to address runtime diagnostics and error tracking.","## Decision

In the current media system it is possible to configure different `Shopware\Core\Content\Media\Pathname\PathnameStrategy\PathnameStrategyInterface`.

These strategies are used to store files, which are uploaded for media entity, under a certain path.

The configured strategy is then also used to generate the URL that is used in the frontend/store API to embed the file.

The generation of this URL is currently triggered in an event subscriber which is registered to the `media.loaded` event.

For generating the URL an implementation of the `UrlGeneratorInterface` is used.
```php
interface UrlGeneratorInterface
{
    public function getAbsoluteMediaUrl(MediaEntity $media): string;

    public function getRelativeMediaUrl(MediaEntity $media): string;

## Decision

We will refactor the URL generation process to decouple it from the `media.loaded` event subscriber, and tightly integrate the `PathnameStrategyInterface` implementations with the `UrlGeneratorInterface`.

Key decisions:

1. Move URL generation out of the event subscriber and into dedicated services implementing `UrlGeneratorInterface`.
2. Use the configured `PathnameStrategyInterface` implementation directly within the URL generator service to produce URLs.
3. The URL generator service will provide both absolute and relative URLs for media and thumbnails, leveraging the pathname strategy methods:
   - `generatePathHash`
   - `generatePathCacheBuster`
   - `generatePhysicalFilename`
4. Register the URL generator service for dependency injection, configured to use the current pathname strategy service.
5. Update all consumers (frontend/store API) to retrieve media URLs via the URL generator service rather than relying on post-load event modifications.
6. This change will improve cohesion, testability, and simplify URL generation by centralizing the logic aligned closely with storage path strategies.

Benefits:

- Clear separation of concerns between media loading and URL construction.
- Easier to swap or extend pathname strategies without impacting event subscribers.
- Simplifies debugging and maintenance by consolidating URL logic.","## Decision
To address the issues listed above, we will make the following changes to the system:

- The file path will be saved directly to the media entity (and thumbnail) when the file is uploaded.
    - This way we don't have to access the strategy when generating the URL, which might have changed in the meantime.
- We allow to change the file path via API and write it directly when creating the entity
    - This way files can be synchronized directly with an external storage and the path only has to be changed in the entity or given during import.
- To generate the strategy we use new location structs, which can be easily created via a service.
    - So we remove the dependency to the DAL to generate the file path.
- For generating the URL, we implement a new service, which can be operated without entities.
    - The URL generation is more resource efficient and can be done without fully loaded entities.
- The new URL generator uses a new ""cache busting"" system, which writes the updated at timestamp of the media entity as query parameter into the URL.
    - This way the file path can remain the same even if the file is updated. Changes to the entity's meta data will also result in a new URL."

We often need a way between the different Shopware versions to provide a one-time update for data. This is currently done on the way to extend an indexer to this logic and then trigger this via a migration. 
This is of course a possible way to enable certain migrations of data, but this migration is also executed again and again when the indexer is executed. 
With certain data this is critical and can lead to system errors. For example, the one-time migration of media path information.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will introduce a dedicated one-time migration mechanism separate from the indexer logic to handle data migrations that need to run only once per version upgrade. This mechanism will:

- Be triggered explicitly during the upgrade process to ensure one-time execution.
- Maintain a record of completed migrations to avoid repeated runs.
- Allow safe and isolated execution of data transformation logic without causing repeated side effects during normal indexer runs.
- Enable clearer separation between indexer responsibilities and upgrade data migrations, preventing system errors caused by repeated migration executions.","## Decision

We implement a new `PostUpdateIndexer`. This is an extension of the `EntityIndexer` and the system can be adapted 1:1. Also, the indexing registration via database migration can be adapted 1:1. 
However, the indexer is not triggered via the `IndexerRegistry` when a full re-index or an entity written event is triggered.
These indexers are only included after the update process.
In addition to the one-time update of the data, we then often also provide a command that can be used to trigger the migration of the data again."

Our current development process uses ['Experimental features'](./2023-05-10-experimental-features.md) to publish features in an early state to gather feedback regarding those features.
During the implementation, developers may encounter challenges related to the effective management of extensive code scattered throughout the platform, particularly in connection with specific experimental features. This codebase fragmentation presents impediments to the tracking, maintenance, and comprehensive understanding of each feature's scope, thereby hindering our development progress.
 
Potential problems:
* Update `stableVersion` property for Prolonged Experiments
    * When a decision is made to extend an experiment, locating all relevant sections of code for updating the property `stableVersion` in `@experimental` annotation becomes a cumbersome task.
* Deprecation of Killed Features
    * Identifying and marking as deprecated the components associated with a deprecated experimental feature is problematic, particularly when multiple experimental features coexist simultaneously within the platform.
    * The ['Experimental features'](./2023-05-10-experimental-features.md) stipulates the ""Killing Feature"" rule, which mandates that a feature must remain within the platform's codebase until the next major version and be appropriately marked as deprecated. However, it is hardly possible to check with current annotation.

In all the above case main problem is detection to which feature belongs experimental code.","## Decision 
## Decision

To improve management and tracking of experimental features' code, we will introduce explicit feature-scoping metadata within the experimental annotation or a supplementary annotation to clearly associate code with its specific experimental feature.

Key actions:

- Extend the `@experimental` annotation to include a mandatory feature identifier (e.g., `featureName`) that explicitly links the annotated code to a particular experimental feature.
- Adopt tooling to parse these annotations across the codebase to easily locate all code belonging to a given experimental feature.
- Use this feature identifier to automate updates of properties like `stableVersion` for prolonged experiments by aggregating all corresponding annotations.
- Enable automated detection and marking of all code associated with deprecated or killed experimental features by inspecting the feature identifier, easing the deprecation process.
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing annotations but gradually transition to the enhanced annotation to reduce annotation scattering and improve feature code coherence.
- Provide guidelines and enforce the use of this extended annotation during development to ensure all experimental code can be tracked efficiently.

This approach will reduce code scatteredness, simplify maintenance, facilitate feature lifecycle management, and improve developer awareness of experimental feature boundaries.","## Decision
To address the existing challenges, we propose implementing a refined approach to the use of the `@experimental` annotation. 

The key modifications are as follows:
* Mandatory `feature` property: 
  * Every `@experimental` annotation will now require a mandatory `feature` property. This property is a string that must contain the name of the associated feature.
* Uniform feature Naming: 
  * To enhance code organization and traceability, all sections of code related to a particular feature must use the same feature name in the `feature` property of the `@experimental` annotation.
  * Feature names should follow the conventions.
    * Feature names cannot contain spaces
    * Feature names should be written in `ALL_CAPS`."

We will introduce unique string identifiers for payment and shipping methods that are consistent and stable across environments.

This ensures that merchants will update their payment and shipping methods accordingly for the upcoming requirement.
An unique index will ensure uniqueness.
Starting from version 6.7.0.0, this `technicalName` field will also become required within the database and the API.

As part of the database migration process, the `technicalName` field will be automatically generated for the default payment and shipping methods provided by Shopware, as illustrated below:

| Type     | Name             | Technical Name          |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Payment  | Debit            | payment_debitpayment    |
| Payment  | Invoice          | payment_invoicepayment  |
| Payment  | Cash on Delivery | payment_cashpayment     |
| Payment  | Pre Payment      | payment_prepayment      |
| Shipping | Standard         | shipping_standard       |
| Shipping | Express          | shipping_express        |

Furthermore, all payment and shipping methods provided by apps will also benefit from the automatic generation of their `technicalName`.
This generation will be based on the app's name and the `identifier` defined for the payment method in the manifest:

| App Name | Identifier         | Technical Name                    |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| MyApp    | my_payment_method  | payment_MyApp_my_payment_method   |
| MyApp    | my_shipping_method | shipping_MyApp_my_shipping_method |"
"## Context

At the moment the Storefront is implementing a lot of custom SCSS inside `app/storefront/src/scss`.
Some custom SCSS is not necessary, and it already exists within Bootstrap as a utility.
For example default spacing with a custom selector:

```scss
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
    margin-bottom: $spacer;
}
```

This can be replaced with a Bootstrap [spacing utility](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/spacing/) in the HTML and the SCSS can be completely removed:

```diff
- <div class=""register-login-collapse-toogle""><div>
+ <div class=""register-login-collapse-toogle mb-3""><div>
```

A class like `register-login-collapse-toogle` should stay in the HTML in case a developer wants to style this specific element.
But there is no need to introduce a new CSS rule using a custom selector to apply a default spacing.

If you implement new UI using mostly utility classes, please consider to still add CSS classes that offer the possibility for themes to add individual styling. For example:

```html
<!-- Classes ""shipping-modal-actions"", ""shipping-abort"" and ""shipping-submit"" are added for better semantics and CSS extensibility, but ship no default CSS. -->
<div class=""border p-3 mb-3 shipping-modal-actions"">
    <button class=""btn btn-light shipping-abort"">Abort</button>
    <button class=""btn btn-primary shipping-submit"">Submit</button>
</div>
```

This principle cannot be applied everywhere. 
For more complex layouts it can still be valid to use custom SCSS because it is not possible to build with default components and utilities, or it would produce a messy template with too many generic utility classes. 
However, for simpler stuff like ""add a border here, add some spacing there"" it's not necessary to implement additional custom styling.","## Decision 
## Decision

* Prefer using Bootstrap utility classes for simple styling needs such as spacing, borders, padding, and margins instead of adding new custom SCSS rules.
* Keep semantic and descriptive CSS classes in HTML to enable theme-specific styling and extendability, but avoid applying default styles through these classes if Bootstrap utilities can cover the requirements.
* Remove existing custom SCSS rules that duplicate Bootstrap utility functionality when feasible, to reduce CSS bloat and improve maintainability.
* For complex layouts or unique style requirements not covered by Bootstrap utilities, continue using custom SCSS to maintain clear and manageable stylesheets.
* Encourage developers to balance between Bootstrap utility classes and meaningful CSS selectors to keep templates clean yet flexible for future theme adjustments.","## Decision

We want to make more use of Bootstrap utilities and get rid of custom SCSS that is not needed.

In order to do so we want to remove unneeded SCSS and add a utility class to the HTML instead (e.g. `mb-3`).
However, this can break styling overrides of themes/apps because most Bootstrap utility classes apply `!important` by default.

Let's stick to the example of `.register-login-collapse-toogle`.
* The core Storefront adds a bottom margin of `$spacer` which equals `1rem`.
* Then `CustomTheme` overrides this selector with a margin bottom of `80px`:

```diff
/* CustomTheme */
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
+    margin-bottom: 80px;
}

/* Storefront */
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
-    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

If the core Storefront would migrate to the utility class it would suddenly overrule the styling of `CustomTheme` because of the `!important` property:

```diff
/* Utility class from HTML overrules CustomTheme */
.mb-3 {
+    margin-bottom: 1rem !important;
}

/* CustomTheme */
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
-    margin-bottom: 80px;
}

/* Storefront */
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
-    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

The theme developer would have no other choice other than using `!important` as well, or modifying the Twig template.

Because of this, we have decided to remove the `!important` from Bootstrap utility classes by changing the [Importance](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/api/#importance) variable `$enable-important-utilities` to `false`.
By doing this, we can use more utilities while at the same time allowing themes to override the same CSS property without using `!important` or editing the template.

Since it is currently expected that Bootstrap utilities add `!important` and overrule almost everything, we do not want to change this right away but from `v6.6.0` onwards."
"## Context
For our ambitions to consequently reduce manual testing in favour for test automation the current E2E test suite, based on Cypress, is not sufficient anymore. It has several flaws that have become a big road-blocker. The test suite is tightly coupled to the state of the test environment, which leads to tests that are not very deterministic and tend to be slow and flaky. Tests are often created in different ways and don't follow a specific strategy. In addition, the test suite is currently not able to test against our cloud environment.

Our goal is to create a test suite that fulfills the following requirements:

*  Deterministic tests that can run against any environment.
*  Fast and reliable tests that follow a certain test strategy.
*  Tests that are derived from real product requirements and validate behaviour.
*  A test framework that is easy to learn and using a readable syntax that also non-tech people can comprehend.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will revamp the E2E testing approach by developing a new test suite with the following principles:

- Ensure deterministic tests by decoupling tests from specific test environment states and enabling tests to run against any environment, including cloud.
- Design tests to be fast and reliable, minimizing flakiness and runtime.
- Align tests closely with real product requirements to validate actual user behavior and system functionality.
- Adopt a test framework that prioritizes readability and ease of use, so that even non-technical stakeholders can understand and contribute to test definitions.
- Establish and enforce a consistent test strategy and patterns to standardize test creation and maintenance.","## Decision
In order to achieve this goal we decided to not further invest time in the existing test suite, but start from scratch. This offers the opportunity to also switch to another test framework that better fulfills our needs. 

After some evaluation we chose Playwright as the new test framework. First benchmarks have shown that it is faster and more stable than Cypress. Additionally, it is easy to learn, has very good documentation and uses a syntax that is easily to understand. It also offers the functionality of creating reusable traces, which come in handy when debugging failing tests from pipelines."
"## Context
1. If flow actions want to interact with the database in a transactional manner, they need to handle it themselves by starting and committing transactions.

2. When there is a problem committing the transaction, the error will be caught and ignored by the flow dispatcher. A vague error message will be logged, but the flows will continue to execute.
This is problematic if a transaction was already started before the flow is executed. If the connection is configured without save points (which is the default with Shopware), when a nested commit fails (eg during a flow action) the connection will be marked as rollback only.
When the outer transaction attempts to commit, eg the calling code, it will be unaware of the previous inner commit failure and thus will also fail.","## Decision 
## Decision

To address transactional integrity and error handling in flow actions:

1. Flow actions that require database transactions must explicitly manage their own transaction lifecycle, including starting, committing, or rolling back transactions as appropriate.

2. The flow dispatcher will be enhanced to properly detect and propagate transaction commit errors rather than silently catching and ignoring them. This aims to ensure that any commit failure inside a flow action does not go unnoticed.

3. For connections configured without save points (such as Shopware's default), nested transactions (or commits within flow actions) are effectively treated as part of the outer transaction. Therefore:
   - If a nested commit fails, the connection will be marked as rollback-only.
   - The flow dispatcher and calling code must be made aware of this state to prevent proceeding with an invalid transaction.

4. To prevent hidden failures:
   - The flow dispatcher should detect transaction failures and propagate exceptions back to the caller instead of logging vague messages and continuing execution.
   - Developers should be encouraged to use save points or properly manage transaction scopes to avoid these nested commit issues.

5. Documentation and guidelines will clarify the above transactional behavior so developers are aware of the risks and required best practices when working with flow actions and database transactions.","## Decision

We introduce a new marker interface `\Shopware\Core\Content\Flow\Dispatching\TransactionalAction` which flow actions can implement.

The flow executor will wrap any action in a database transaction which implements the interface.

Before:

```php
class SetOrderStateAction extends FlowAction implements DelayableAction
{
    public function handleFlow(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {
        $this->connection->beginTransaction();
        
        //do stuff
        
        try {
            $this->connection->commit();
        } catch (\Throwable $e) {
                
        }
    }
}
```

After:

```php

class SetOrderStateAction extends FlowAction implements DelayableAction, TransactionalAction
{
    public function handleFlow(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {        
        //do stuff - will be wrapped in a transaction
    }
}
```

You can also force the flow executor to rollback the transaction by throwing an instance of `\Shopware\Core\Content\Flow\Dispatching\TransactionFailedException`. You can use the static `because` method to create the exception from another one. Eg:

```php

class SetOrderStateAction extends FlowAction implements DelayableAction, TransactionalAction
{
    public function handleFlow(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {        
        try {
            //search for some record
            $entity = $this->repo->find(...);
        } catch (NotFoundException $e) {
            throw TransactionFailedException::because($e);
        }
    }
}
```

The transaction will be rollback if either of the following are true:

1. If Doctrine throws an instance of `Doctrine\DBAL\Exception` during commit.
2. If the action throws an instance of `TransactionFailedException` during execution.
3. If another non-handled exception is thrown during the action execution. This is to aid debugging.

If the transaction fails, then the error will be logged. Also, if the transaction has been performed inside a nested transaction without save points enabled, the exception will be rethrown.
So that the calling code knows something went wrong and is able to handle it correctly, by rolling back instead of committing. As, in this instance, the connection will be marked as rollback only."

Vue 3 introduced a new compatibility mode to ease the migration from Vue 2 to Vue 3. This mode is enabled by default
and allows the use of most Vue 2 features in a Vue 3 application. This mode is only recommended for the transition period
and should be turned off as soon as possible.

We have kept the compatibility mode enabled in the administration because it makes it easier for plugins to migrate 
and results in fewer breaking changes during the major release. This splits the work of migrating the administration
and the plugins into two separate majors instead of one.","## Decision 
## Decision

We decide to keep the Vue 3 compatibility mode enabled in the administration for the upcoming major release to ease the migration process for plugins. This approach reduces the immediate breaking changes for plugin developers and allows them to adapt their codebases gradually.

However, we plan to disable the compatibility mode in a subsequent major release once the administration and majority of plugins have migrated fully to Vue 3 conventions. This phased approach helps split the migration effort into manageable parts and provides a smoother transition path for the ecosystem.","## Decision

Migrating all components in one by disabling the compatibility mode for the whole administration is a huge task and
would make it hard to keep the administration stable during the migration. We decided to disable the compatibility mode
per component level. This allows us to migrate components one by one and keep the administration stable during the migration.

This gives all teams and plugin developers the possibility to migrate their components to Vue 3 without waiting for the
whole administration to be migrated and for the global removal of the compatibility mode.

To activate the new mode, the `DISABLE_VUE_COMPAT` feature flag must be enabled. Then, it is possible to disable the
compatibility mode on a per-component level by setting the `compatConfig` option in the component to our custom configuration.
This custom configuration is exposed in `Shopware.compatConfig` and has all compatibility features disabled if the 
feature flag is activated."

In our current architecture, we rely heavily on PHP decoration, Adapter, and Factory patterns to allow for extensions and customizations by third-party developers. While these patterns are effective, they present significant challenges:

1. **Backward and Forward Compatibility:**
    - Maintaining backward and forward compatibility with these patterns is complex and labor-intensive. Each change or update can potentially break existing extensions or require extensive rework to ensure compatibility.

2. **Process Extension Limitations:**
    - These patterns do not inherently allow for the extension of subprocesses unless these subprocesses are extracted into separate classes and interfaces. This extraction often results in a proliferation of interfaces, abstract classes, and their implementations.

3. **Proliferation of Code:**
    - The need to extract subprocesses into separate entities leads to an overwhelming number of interfaces and abstract classes. This proliferation makes the codebase more difficult to understand and maintain, and increases the cognitive load on developers.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will limit the reliance on PHP decoration, Adapter, and Factory patterns for extensibility and customization to strike a better balance between flexibility and maintainability.

- Avoid extracting subprocesses into separate classes and interfaces solely for extension purposes unless there is a clear, justified benefit. This aims to reduce the proliferation of interfaces and abstract classes.
- For backward and forward compatibility, establish and document clear extension points and maintain strict semantic versioning to minimize breaking changes.
- Explore alternative extensibility mechanisms that reduce complexity and cognitive load on developers, such as plugin systems with defined extension APIs or configuration-driven behavior where appropriate.
- Continuously review and refactor existing code to consolidate and simplify extension points, reducing unnecessary abstractions while preserving the ability for third-party customization.","## Decision

To address these challenges, we have decided to transition to an event-based extension system. This new approach will replace the existing decoration, Adapter, and Factory patterns as the primary method for extending and customizing our system."

Currently, our component tests in Jest are running with enabled compat mode. To remove the compat mode for each
component, we need to add a new Jest runner with disabled compat mode to make sure that the tests are running without compat mode.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will create a new Jest runner configuration that disables the compat mode specifically for component tests.  
This allows us to run tests without compat mode enabled while keeping the existing setup intact, enabling a smooth transition and targeted testing without compat mode interference.","## Decision

I added a new runner command in the NPM scripts to run the Jest tests without compat mode. The new runner command is
`unit:disabled-compat` and `unit-watch:disabled-compat`. Also, the composer commands are added to run the tests. These commands are `admin:unit:disabled-compat` and `admin:unit-watch:disabled-compat`. These commands are using the environment variable `DISABLE_JEST_COMPAT_MODE` to disable the compat mode.

For the pipeline, I added a new stage to run the Jest tests without compat mode. The stage is `Jest (Administration with disabled compat mode)`.

To mark a test file working without the compat mode you need to add a comment with the `@group` tag. The tag is `@group disabledCompat`.

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * @package admin
 * @group disabledCompat
 */

import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils';

async function createWrapper() {
...
```

With this tag, the test file is running without compat mode. To make a component working for both modes, you can use the
compatUtils helper function from Vue compat:
```javascript
// Example
import { compatUtils } from '@vue/compat';

...

if (compatUtils.isCompatEnabled('INSTANCE_LISTENERS')) {
    return this.$listeners;
}

return {};

...
```


Important: the test still runs also with compat mode activated in parallel."

In some instances, a system rollout was completed where an error in certain system functionalities was not detected until the system was live.

System health checks are a way to monitor the health of a system and detect failures early.","## Decision 
## Decision

To improve detection of system issues early and avoid live environment errors, we will implement comprehensive system health checks across all components. These health checks will:

* Monitor the status of individual system components regularly.
* Provide aggregated system health status to reflect overall service functionality.
* Trigger alerts or automated responses upon detection of unhealthy components or failure conditions.
* Allow systems to degrade gracefully, enabling continued operation despite non-critical component failures.
* Be integrated into deployment and rollout processes to verify system readiness before full production release.

This approach ensures early identification of issues, facilitates faster remediation, and improves overall system reliability and stability during and after rollouts.","## Decision

To be able to unit test the upcoming major feature in other plugins we will enable the possibility to add other
namespaces to
the `Shopware\Core\Test\PHPUnit\Extension\FeatureFlag\Subscriber\TestPreparationStartedSubscriber`.

We'll add a static method called `addNamespace()` method to the
`Shopware\Core\Test\PHPUnit\Extension\FeatureFlag\FeatureFlagExtension` and by this we are able to add other namespaces
to the allowlist of the namespaces to be considered when enabling the major flags in the unit test suite.

This can be useful for plugins that wants to enable the major flags in their unit tests suite.

Therefore, add the extension to the extension list in the `phpunit.xml`:

```xml

<extensions>
    ...
    <bootstrap class=""Shopware\Core\Test\PHPUnit\Extension\FeatureFlag\FeatureFlagExtension""/>
</extensions>

And register your test namespace in your test bootstrap file:

```php
FeatureFlagExtension::addTestNamespace('Your\\Unit\\Tests\\Namespace\\');

Our Vue.js application currently uses the Options API, which is the traditional way of writing Vue components in Vue 2. With the release of Vue 3, the Composition API was introduced, offering improved code organization, better TypeScript support, and enhanced reusability of component logic. For more detailed information about the reasons for migrating to the Composition API, see the [documentation entry](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/administration/system-updates/vue-native.html).

To modernize our codebase and take advantage of these benefits, we need to migrate our existing Vue 2 Options API components to use the Vue 3 Composition API. Manual conversion of numerous components would be time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, we need an automated solution to assist in this migration process.","## Decision

We decide to implement an automated refactoring tool to convert our existing Vue 2 Options API components to the Vue 3 Composition API. This approach will:

- Accelerate the migration process by handling repetitive and mechanical transformations automatically.
- Reduce human errors that could occur during manual conversions.
- Ensure consistency across the migrated components.
- Allow developers to focus on more complex migration issues and optimizations.

The refactoring tool will parse existing components, transform the Options API syntax into the Composition API pattern, and generate updated code accordingly. After automatic conversion, developers will review and adjust the resulting code where necessary to handle edge cases and specific business logic.

By adopting this automated migration strategy, we aim to modernize our codebase efficiently, improving code organization, maintainability, and TypeScript compatibility aligned with the benefits of Vue 3.","## Decision

We have decided to implement a Codemod in the form of an ESLint rule to automatically convert Vue 2 Options API components to Vue 3 Composition API. This Codemod will:

1. Identify Vue component definitions in the codebase.
2. Convert the following Options API features to their Composition API equivalents:
    - Convert `data` properties to `ref` or `reactive`.
    - Convert `computed` properties to `computed()` functions.
    - Convert `methods` to regular functions within the `setup()` function.
    - Convert lifecycle hooks to their Composition API equivalents (e.g., `mounted` to `onMounted`).
    - Convert Vue 2 specific lifecycle hooks to their Vue 3 equivalents.
    - Convert `watch` properties to `watch()` functions.
    - Handle `props` and `inject` conversions.
    - Replace `this` references with direct references to reactive variables.
    - Convert writable computed properties.
    - Handle reactive object reassignments using `Object.assign`
    - Handle correct usage of `ref` and replace the access to the value with `.value`.

3. Generate a `setup()` function containing the converted code.
4. Add necessary imports for Composition API functions (e.g., `ref`, `reactive`, `computed`, `watch`).

The Codemod will be implemented as an ESLint rule to leverage the existing ESLint ecosystem and allow for easy integration into our development workflow."

Moving blocks from TwigJs to Vue.js creates consistency in the technology stack, simplifying development and reducing the cognitive load on developers who previously had to switch between TwigJs and Vue.js.

2. **Improved Flexibility**: With Vue.js blocks we have control over the provided access to the componentÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂ¯s internals, allowing for more granular control over block behavior and content.

The Storefront JavaScript currently offers a helper class `src/helper/iterator.helper.js` that can iterate over different objects like Maps, FormData, plain arrays etc.
Using this approach has several downsides we want to address.

* It creates an unnecessary abstraction over the native alternative. Very often the `Iterator.iterate()` directly uses js plain `forEach` loop without any additional logic. Using the abstraction is actually creating more complexity.
* It prevents the developer from using the appropriate loop for the given data type and instead passes it to an iterator that does it with arbitrary data types.
* The iterator is a special shopware syntax that needs to be understood and documented. It is way easier to use web standards that everyone knows and that is also officially documented already.
* The usage throughout the codebase is inconsistent and the iterator helper is used alongside the native loops which can create confusion.
* It creates the impression that the data that is being iterated is some special custom object that needs a special iterator helper. In reality, it is a simple `NodeList` in 90% of the time.
* It creates an additional dependency/import in every file that is using it.","## Decision 
## Decision

We decided to deprecate the `src/helper/iterator.helper.js` in favor of using native JavaScript iteration constructs directly.

* Developers should use the appropriate native iteration method for the given data type, such as `Array.prototype.forEach`, `for...of`, or other standard loops.
* This removes the unnecessary abstraction and complexity introduced by the custom iterator helper.
* It aligns the codebase with web standards, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the code without learning shopware-specific iteration helpers.
* Usage across the codebase will be standardized by refactoring existing code to remove the iterator helper and replace it with native loops.
* Eliminating the dependency reduces imports and simplifies modules that perform iterations.
* Documentation will be updated to guide developers towards native iteration practices and discourage use of the deprecated iterator helper.","## Decision

For all the above reasons we have decided to deprecate `src/helper/iterator.helper.js`, stop using it, and use native alternatives instead.
We want to have a more lean and simple Storefront JavaScript that needs less special things to learn and understand."
"## Context

Currently, flows are executed during the business process. A business
process is any event that is triggered by the user, like a checkout or
a product update. Flows are used to react to these events and execute user defined actions.

There are several downsides to this approach. The most straightforward is the possibility of a fatal error during
the execution of any flow. This will inevitably cancel the in progress business process. While there are remedies in place
to avoid any trivial errors in flow execution disrupting the business process, certain errors can not be avoided.

Further, even if all flows execute without error, they noticeably impact business process performance. Flows are often 
employed to, for example, send mails, an expensive operation that is not necessary to complete the business process.

In addition to these concrete disadvantages, there are also some more abstract ones. For one, currently flows are executed directly
from a decorator of Symfony's `EventDispatcher`, leading to cumbersome debugging and bloated stack traces. This would
be improved if flows are executed by a dedicated event listener. Additionally moving flows to their own execution
environment would not only simplify debugging, but also potentially make expanding their capabilities easier.

> *The following is all experimental and only takes effect if the associated feature flag `FLOW_EXECUTION_AFTER_BUSINESS_PROCESS` is enabled*","## Decision 
## Decision

To improve robustness and performance of business processes, flows will be executed asynchronously after the main business process completes.

Concretely:

- Flows are no longer executed directly inside the business process or within decorators of Symfony's `EventDispatcher`. Instead, flows will be dispatched to a dedicated event listener or processing environment.

- By moving flow execution outside the critical path of the business process, fatal errors occurring during flow execution will no longer interrupt or rollback the business process.

- This separation also reduces the performance impact on the business process, as expensive operations like sending emails are deferred.

- Debugging is improved by isolating flow execution in its own environment or listener, leading to clearer stack traces.

- This approach will be guarded behind a feature flag `FLOW_EXECUTION_AFTER_BUSINESS_PROCESS`, allowing gradual adoption and testing.

Overall, moving flow execution after the main business process asynchronously enhances reliability, performance, and maintainability.","## Decision


We will move the flow execution after the business process. As outlined above we believe that this will simplify the
development around flows, while also improving their performance and safeguarding the main execution environment.

To ensure that flows are executed as close to the business process that triggered them as possible, we will
'queue' the flow execution. This means that flows will be executed after the business process has finished.
Flows are stored in memory and executed as soon as the execution environment signals, that it has
finished a unit of work. The associated events are as follows:

1. After a controller action has been executed (Web) => `KernelEvents::TERMINATE`
2. After a queued message has been processed (Queue) => `WorkerMessageHandledEvent`
3. After a command has been executed (CLI) => `ConsoleEvents::TERMINATE`

Another option would be to handle flow executions as queue messages. This would entirely remove
flow executions from the runtime of the business process. While this would be a simpler solution,
it would both make debugging more complex and introduce an unpredictable delay between the business
process and the flow execution. While this delay could be mitigated by using a high priority queue,
it could not reliably be kept under a certain threshold. To entirely avoid this delay, we decided
that the flow execution should be handled as close to the business process as possible."

"## Context and Problem Statement

The Metadata API provides a modern Python API for accessing individual pieces
of metadata. It does not provide any wider context help to someone looking to
implement a TUF repository.

The legacy python-tuf implementation offers tools for this but suffers from
some issues (as do many other implementations):
* There is a _very_ large amount of code to maintain: repo.py,
  repository_tool.py and repository_lib.py alone are almost 7000 lines of code.
* The ""library like"" parts of the implementation do not form a good coherent
  API: methods routinely have a large number of arguments, code still depends
  on globals in a major way and application (repo.py) still implements a lot of
  ""repository code"" itself
* The ""library like"" parts of the implementation make decisions that look like
  application decisions. As an example, repository_tool loads _every_ metadata
  file in the repository: this is fine for CLI that operates on a small
  repository but is unlikely to be a good choice for a large scale server.","## Decision 
## Decision

A new Python repository library will be developed to provide a clean, modular, and maintainable API for TUF repository operations that addresses the legacy implementation issues.

Key decisions are:

* The new library will offer well-defined, coherent interfaces that separate library functionality from application logic.
* It will minimize the number of arguments in methods and avoid reliance on globals to improve clarity and testability.
* The codebase will be modular, concise, and easier to maintain compared to the legacy monolithic approach.
* Repository loading operations will be designed to be efficient and configurable, avoiding unnecessary loading of all metadata to better suit large-scale server environments.
* This design encourages reuse, extensibility, and better integration with other tools, improving overall developer experience and maintainability.","## Decision Drivers

* There is a consensus on removing the legacy code from python-tuf due to
  maintainability issues
* Metadata API makes modifying metadata far easier than legacy code base: this
  makes significantly different designs possible
* Not providing a ""repository library"" (and leaving implementers on their own)
  may be a short term solution because of the previous point, but to make
  adoption easier and to help adopters create safe implementations the project
  would benefit from some shared repository code and a shared repository design 
* Maintainability of new library code must be a top concern
* Allowing a wide range of repository implementations (from CLI tools to
  minimal in-memory implementations to large scale application servers)
  would be good: unfortunately these can have wildly differing requirements"

Primer React components was originally released without TypeScript type definitions, making it difficult for engineers to consume the library in TypeScript applications. In [July 2019](https://github.com/primer/react/commit/2983c935ea9ad600c04078adb25e40c3624c11fa#diff-7aa4473ede4abd9ec099e87fec67fd57afafaf39e05d493ab4533acc38547eb8), we created an [ambient declaration](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/typescript-ambients-declaration/) file (`index.d.ts`) file to provide type definitions for TypeScript applications without having to rewrite Primer React components in TypeScript.

`index.d.ts` has been an effective stopgap, enabling teams to build complex applications with Primer React components and TypeScript. However, because `index.d.ts` is disconnected from the implementation code, we've struggled to keep the type definitions up-to-date and accurate, as evidenced by [many](https://github.com/primer/react/issues/906) [TypeScript](https://github.com/primer/react/issues/540) [bug](https://github.com/primer/react/issues/520) [reports](https://github.com/primer/react/issues/534). As the library continues to grow in size and complexity, manually maintaining type definitions will become unsustainable.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will migrate Primer React components to be written in TypeScript directly instead of relying on ambient declaration files (`index.d.ts`). This will ensure type definitions are always up-to-date and in sync with the implementation, improving type safety and reducing TypeScript bug reports.

We will phase the migration incrementally, updating components one at a time to TypeScript to minimize disruption. During the transition, we will maintain compatibility so that users of the library can continue to consume components without breaking changes.","## Decision

We will rewrite Primer React components in TypeScript."
"## Context

In Primer React and consuming applications, we use many different patterns for creating React components. Two common patterns are:

1. Creating components with styled-components

   ```tsx
   const Avatar = styled.img.attrs<StyledAvatarProps>(props => ({
     height: props.size,
     width: props.size,
   }))<StyledAvatarProps>`
     display: inline-block;
     overflow: hidden;
     line-height: ${get('lineHeights.condensedUltra')};
     border-radius: ${props => getBorderRadius(props)};
     ${sx}
   `
   ```

   [Show full code example ÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂº](https://github.com/primer/react/pull/2019/files?diff=split&w=0)

2. Creating components with Box

   ```tsx
   const Avatar: React.FC<AvatarProps> = ({size = 20, alt = '', square = false, sx = {}, ...props}) => {
     const styles: BetterSystemStyleObject = {
       display: 'inline-block',
       overflow: 'hidden',
       lineHeight: 'condensedUltra',
       borderRadius: getBorderRadius({size, square}),
     }

     return (
       <Box
         as=""img""
         alt={alt}
         sx={merge<BetterSystemStyleObject>(styles, sx)} // styles needs to merge with props.sx
         {...props}
       />
     )
   }
   ```

   [Show full code example ÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂº](https://github.com/primer/react/pull/2019/files?diff=split&w=0)

&nbsp;","## Decision  
## Decision

To maintain consistency across Primer React components and simplify our component creation patterns, we will choose to standardize on using the Box component pattern for new and refactored components instead of styled-components.

Rationale:

* The Box pattern enables more straightforward style composition via the `sx` prop, improving flexibility and theming capabilities.
* It avoids duplication by merging internal styles with any styles passed through `sx`, promoting better customization.
* Box components leverage the system style conventions already prevalent in Primer React, ensuring consistency.
* The pattern results in simpler component definitions without losing expressiveness or styling power.

Exceptions can be made for cases requiring complex CSS selectors or unique attribute handling that Box patterns cannot easily express, where styled-components may still be used. However, the general approach favors Box for maintainability and uniformity.","## Decision

Prefer using method #2: Creating components with Box for the following reasons:

- Better authoring experience with Typescript. With Box, we can improve the API and autocomplete for consuming primitives. [See research](https://github.com/github/primer/discussions/755#discussioncomment-2318144)
- The styling library (i.e. styled-components) becomes an implementation detail and can be changed later with minimal breaking changes for consumers. (Avoids leaky abstractions)
- We have had issues with exporting types, we can increase confidence by keeping the exported types close to what we author.

See diff for moving Avatar from approach 1 to 2: https://github.com/primer/react/pull/2019/files?diff=split&w=0"
"## Context

`Drafts` were introduced in [ADR-006](./adrs/adr-006-drafts.md) as a way of creating components outside of the root bundle of `@primer/react`. This helps us create, test and maintain multiple versions of the same component in parallel.

Example:

```js
// default version of component exported from root of package
import {UnderlineNav} from '@primer/react'

// new version of component exported from /drafts
import {UnderlineNav} from '@primer/react/drafts'
```

We have also used this method for components that are still a work in progress and we don't want developers to start using them in production without collaborating with us first.

Example:

```js
// this component only exists in drafts and not in the roof of the package
import {TreeView} from '@primer/react/drafts'
```","## Decision 
## Decision

Continue using the `Drafts` pattern within `@primer/react` by exporting in-progress or multiple versions of components under the `/drafts` path to allow parallel development and testing while preventing premature production use.","## Decision

We should drop the `draft` label and use `experimental` instead.

While not completely accurate (UnderlineNav2 is much more polished than `experimental` maturity), the lack of confusion makes it a good trade-off.

Fine-grained information about component maturity, useful for maintainers, is also communicated by the [status checklist in the component documentation](https://primer.style/react/drafts/UnderlineNav2#status)."
"## Context

[Snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing) is a strategy that allows a developer to ""snapshot"" a given value within a test suite. This value could be a primitive within JavaScript, an Array, an object, or the resulting HTML of rendering a component in React. The snapshot of the value is stored within the repo and is then compared against future test runs.

When a change is detected to a snapshot, the test will fail with a diff between the currently stored snapshot and the new snapshot. Within the space of React components, this may happen when a class name changes or the markup of a component changes. Is is then up to the developer to decide if the change is intentional and whether or not to accept this new snapshot as the baseline for future test runs.

A common practice is to snapshot a React component which will capture the HTML output of rendering a component. For example:

```jsx
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer'
import Link from '../Link'

it('renders correctly', () => {
  const tree = renderer.create(<Link page=""http://www.facebook.com"">Facebook</Link>).toJSON()
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot()
})
```

```js
exports[`renders correctly 1`] = `
<a
  className=""normal""
  href=""http://www.facebook.com""
  onMouseEnter={[Function]}
  onMouseLeave={[Function]}
>
  Facebook
</a>
`
```

[Source](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing#snapshot-testing-with-jest)

As the number of snapshots within a project grows, there are a couple of challenges that emerge:

- Components with wide or deep trees emit large snapshots
- Debugging what change lead to a broken snapshot can be difficult
- It is unclear what the intent may be of a snapshot test when something does fail, in other words it does not always answer the question: what is this testing?","## Decision 
## Decision

We will adopt snapshot testing with Jest for React components but with the following guidelines to mitigate common challenges:

- Keep snapshots small and focused by snapshotting only key component outputs or smaller subcomponents instead of large trees.
- Use descriptive test and snapshot names to increase clarity on what each snapshot is meant to test.
- Review snapshot diffs carefully to understand why a snapshot changed before accepting updates.
- Combine snapshot testing with other test strategies that validate component behavior explicitly.
- Periodically prune unused or less relevant snapshots to keep the test suite maintainable and helpful.","## Decision

- Avoid using ""catch-all"" snapshot tests for React components
- Snapshots may be used for static objects which have a clear signal as to what to do if they are modified (such as the exports of a package)

There are situations where we would like to provide warnings to developers who
use `@primer/react` that something may be deprecated, unsupported, etc. Often,
these will be emitted using `console.warn()`. When using `console.warn()` by
itself, we run into a situation where code that is only meant for development
is included in production code. As a result, it would be helpful to establish
patterns around how to provide warnings to developers in order to make sure
that:

- Calls to `console.warn()` do not appear in production
- Code related to development checks, warnings, or messages are removed from
  production code","## Decision 
## Decision

We will establish a pattern to handle developer warnings by wrapping all `console.warn()` calls within a development-only utility function that checks the environment. This function will only emit warnings when `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.

To ensure that no `console.warn()` calls appear in production builds and that development-specific code is removed, we will:

- Use a dedicated `warn` utility function that internally calls `console.warn()` only in development mode.
- Utilize build-time tooling like dead code elimination provided by bundlers (e.g., webpack, Rollup, or esbuild) to strip out development-only code blocks guarded by environment checks.
- Enforce linting rules to prevent direct use of `console.warn()` outside the utility function.

This approach guarantees that warning messages are visible to developers during development while being omitted entirely in production, optimizing bundle size and performance.","## Decision

Code that is meant for development-only warnings or checks **must** be wrapped within a
`__DEV__` block.

```tsx
function ExampleComponent() {
  if (__DEV__) {
    // This code only runs in development
  }
}
```

Under-the-hood, the `__DEV__` block will be compiled to a `NODE_ENV` check so
that it is stripped when `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`.

> **Note**
> Contributors may wrap hooks within a `__DEV__` block even though hooks are not
> meant to be called conditionally. This is because the `__DEV__` check can be
> considered constant in that it will always be true or false for the
> environment (development or production).

When a contributor would like to communicate a warning to a developer, they
should use the `warning()` helper.

```ts
warning(condition, 'This is the message that is logged when condition is truth-y')
```

This helper allows you to provide a `condition`. When the condition is truth-y
it will emit the message provided. This helper is automatically wrapped in a
`__DEV__` block and will be removed from production builds.

For more complex conditions, a contributor may combine `console.warn()` with
`__DEV__` when `warning()` does not suffice."
"## Context

There are several components in Primer React that make use of live regions.
However, the library does not have a central pattern for making accessible live
region announcements. This ADR documents the decision to use a central pattern
for live region announcements that can be used across Primer and GitHub.

ARIA Live regions fall into several buckets that we may want to use as component
authors:

- [ARIA live region roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#live_region_roles), such as `alert`, `log`, or `status`
- [The `aria-live` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-live) to turn an element into a live region

In components, we see the following scenarios in Primer React:

- Announce the contents of an element when it is rendered or on page load, like when a spinner is displayed or a form is submitted
- Announce the changes to the content of an element, like when the count inside of a
  button is incremented
- Announce a message programmatically, such as the number of results for a query

Currently, contributors may reach for roles such as `alert` or `status` to
achieve these scenarios. They may also add `aria-live=""assertive""` or `aria-live=""polite""` with an an `aria-atomic=""true""` to an element explicitly.
However, both of these approaches do not announce consistently across screen
readers. This could be due to live regions being injected dynamically into the document (this includes loading content into the document via React), dynamically changing the visibility of a live region, or some other technique causing an announcement to not be announced.

For more information about the ways in which live regions may not work as
expected, visit: [Why are my live regions not working?](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2024/05/01/why-are-my-live-regions-not-working/)","## Decision 
## Decision

Adopt a centralized live region manager component for Primer React that abstracts ARIA live region announcements into a uniform and consistent API.

Key elements:
- Implement a dedicated React context provider that manages a small number of live region containers, each with appropriate ARIA roles like `alert`, `status`, or `log`, and `aria-live` attributes.
- Provide API hooks or functions that components can call to programmatically send announcements to these live regions without directly manipulating the DOM.
- Use techniques such as recycling DOM nodes, clearing and repopulating live region text nodes, and managing timing to improve consistency of announcements across a variety of screen readers.
- Ensure the API covers common scenarios:
  * Announcing content upon mount or page load (e.g., spinner visible)
  * Announcing dynamic changes like count increments
  * Programmatic announcements independent of rendered content
- Document the live region manager usage pattern within Primer React and recommend it as the standard approach for accessibility announcements.
- Avoid relying on dynamic DOM injection of live regions or setting visibility toggles directly on live region elements to prevent inconsistent announcements.
- Validate implementation accessibility and reliability with major screen readers and browsers.

This approach consolidates live region logic, reduces inconsistent or missed announcements, and simplifies accessibility support across Primer and GitHub components.","## Decision

In order to have a common interop point for live region announcements, Primer React will
make use of a `live-region` custom element from `@primer/live-region-element`.
This package will be included and published from the `primer/react` repo.

The custom element exposes a way to make announcements that can be used
across frameworks. This makes it useful not only for Primer but GitHub as a
whole. The `@primer/live-region-element` exports two helpers to use for making
announcements: `announce()` and `announceFromElement`. Both helpers can be used
when working in Primer and by teams at GitHub.

In addition, `@primer/react` will leverage and export the following helpers for
use within Primer React and GitHub:

- The `AriaStatus` component to correspond with `role=""status""`
- The `AriaAlert` component to correspond with `role=""alert""`

Within `@primer/react`, we should lint against usage of `aria-live` and the
corresponding roles (if possible) and suggest using these alternatives instead.

> [!NOTE]
> Both `AriaStatus` and `AriaAlert` will trigger an announcement when the component is
> rendered. As a result, they should only be used for dynamically rendered
> content. Otherwise, they will trigger announcements on page load. In cases
> where they should always be present, then the first message passed to the
> component should be an empty string. Changes to the content of the component
> will trigger subsequent announcements."

1. npm package: ""Experimental"" components, as defined by the component lifecycle, should not be part of semantically versioned npm package for `@primer/react`.

2. npm package: Each experimental component should be independently published and versioned with semver. Breaking changes should be tagged as major versions. Example: `@github/experimental-react-commentbox`

3. The code for experimental components should live in a new repository, example: [github/react-experimental](https://github.com/github/react-experimental) and published as individual packages as suggested in point 2.

Our testing infrastructure consists of Jest ""unit"" tests and automatic Chromatic visual testing. Both of these are super useful but we have been experiencing a few setbacks.
Unofficially we test more complex interactive scenarios using our storybooks setup.

1. Repeated markup in storybooks and jest tests - Since there is not automation of interaction in storybooks, we tend to test them out manually in stories and then transfer to jest. This results in us constructing similar test case scenarios in storybooks and in tests.

2. Debugging complex jest tests - There is no visual aspect to jest tests. Mostly everything is CLI based. This makes it hard to debug broken tests. Visibility into these tests is also low for people who want to enhance them.","## Decision 
## Decision

To address the challenges of duplicated markup and limited visibility/debugging in Jest and storybook testing, we have decided to:

1. Integrate automated interaction testing directly within Storybook using tools like [Storybook Testing Library](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/introduction) or similar, allowing us to write interaction tests once and reuse them both visually and programmatically.

2. Enhance Jest tests with visual snapshots or integrate Jest with Storybook snapshots to provide visual context during test failures.

3. Utilize Chromatic's capabilities to capture and highlight UI differences, improving visual debugging.

4. Improve developer accessibility by documenting standard testing patterns and providing easy access to both storybook and Jest test cases to minimize the cognitive load and repetitive work.","## Decisions

Going forward, we can use [storybook's play functions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function) to write interaction tests for our components. Here's a document that describes [how to add and run these tests](../storybook-tests.md).
Guidelines to make this easier -

1. Create a new storybook file for your components and call them ""interactions"". Inside these files, we can import the stories from ""examples"" or ""fixtures"" and tack on play functions to them. This will create duplicate stories but with the added benefit of the tests appearing in the interactions add-on tab. This tab will let you step through your tests step by step, increasing visibility and debuggability.

2. Port complex jest tests onto interactive tests. This is up to developer discretion. My recommendation is to have basic ""unit"" tests like component existence and axe tests in jest. Anything that can benefit from a visual aspect to it can be moved to interaction tests.

3. Interaction tests are not perfect. Some aspects like mocking can be challenging and we will find solutions to these as when the need arises."

> tl;dr
>
> We have workspaces within the project but no official way of connecting them or managing dependencies from the top-level. Similarly, scripts that grow in size or complexity have no dedicated home or ability to manage dependencies outside of the top-level workspace.

The `primer/react` repo is composed of several workspaces that use `npm` to manage dependencies. In order to install these dependencies, a contributor needs to visit each directory and run `npm install`. The project also has a convenience script for this task, invoked through `npm run setup`, that goes through this process for contributors.

These distinct workspaces may sometimes depend on each other. For example, the `docs` workspace depends on the `@primer/react` package which is defined at the top-level of the project. Similarly, examples in the `examples/*` folders may also depend on `@primer/react`. Currently these dependencies are expressed either through relative paths, file dependencies in `package.json`, or symlinks through `npm link`.

There is also a collection of scripts under the `script` directory that exist in the project that involve varying levels of complexity and depth.","## Decision 
## Decision

The project will adopt a top-level dependency management strategy using npm workspaces.

This will include:
- Defining all sub-packages and examples as npm workspaces in the root `package.json`.
- Allowing npm to manage dependency installation and linking automatically across workspaces with a single `npm install` command.
- Refactoring all inter-workspace dependencies to use workspace references rather than relative paths or manual symlinks.
- Creating a dedicated `scripts` workspace or directory in the root to manage complex scripts and their dependencies independently.
- Updating the setup procedure to rely on the enhanced workspace capabilities, removing the need for manual installs in each subdirectory.

This approach simplifies dependency management, ensures consistent versions across workspaces, and provides a maintainable structure for scripts and package interdependencies.","## Decision

Setup the project to use [`npm` workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces). This will require changing the project to have a top-level `package.json` file which will use `workspaces` to reference child workspaces. The layout for the project would then be:

```
- root
  # Root package.json, defines workspaces
  - package.json

  # Workspaces
  - docs
  - packages
    - react
    - *
  - examples
    - nextjs
    - consumer-test
    - *

  # Top-level scripts
  - script

  # Testing & Development
  - .storybook
  - .playwright

  # Repo config
  - .github
  - .vscode

The following items will be installed and ran at the root-level:

- Linting
  - `eslint`
  - `markdownlint`
- Testing
  - Jest
  - Playwright
- Development
  - Storybook
- Type checking
  - TypeScript

Certain configuration items, like for TypeScript or Babel, may need configuration defined at the top-level and extended by child workspaces.

The current `@primer/react` package will move to the `packages/react` package. Workspaces that depend on `@primer/react` should reference the version of that package."
"## Context

Currently all files live under the `src` directory. In the `npm` package for `@primer/react`, we specify the following export pattern:

```json5

  exports: {

        // ...
      ],
      require: [
        // ...
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

This pattern, along with our Rollup setup, opts-in files and folders under the `src` directory into the public API of the package. This means that certain parts of the codebase which aren't intended to be used outside of `@primer/react` are considered part of its public API and can be imported and used by consumers.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will restructure the codebase by moving all source files intended to be part of the public API outside of the `src` directory into a dedicated `lib-esm` directory. This aligns with the `exports` field in the `package.json` and Rollup configuration, ensuring only intended files are exposed publicly.

Internal implementation files and folders not meant for public consumption will remain under `src` or be moved to a separate internal directory, preventing accidental public API exposure.

This approach enforces clearer separation between public API and internal code, improving maintainability and preventing unintended usage by consumers.","## Decision

Adopt a convention in Primer React where internal modules live in the `src/internal` folder. This folder which would include all components, hooks, and other modules which are not intended for usage outside of the project. Files within `src/internal` may be grouped by area, such as `src/internal/components`, `src/internal/hooks`, etc.

In the `""exports""` field of our `npm` package, we can then add the following pattern:

```json5
{
  exports: {
    // ...
    './lib-esm/internal/*': null,
  },
}
```

This pattern would remove any files and folders within `src/internal` from the public API of the `npm` package. This pattern is inspired by [this section](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#package-entry-points) from Node.js, specifically this example:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""my-package"",
  ""exports"": {
    ""."": ""./lib/index.js"",
    ""./feature/*.js"": ""./feature/*.js"",
    ""./feature/internal/*"": null
  }
}

Reasons for change: Performance, utilise css variables

The main reason for changing our styling architecture is to remove performance issues for applications:

Relevant parts from [primer/discussions#1928](https://github.com/github/primer/discussions/1928#reasons)(Hubbers only link):

1. Initial page loads take longer

   Because styles are injected during runtime, we can not parallelize this work. The page is un-styled till the javascript bundle is
   downloaded and processed. The processing time is longer on slower devices.

   Benchmarks:

   i. Lab benchmarks: rendering a page with 1000 components
   runtime injection of css: 242ms
   static .css files: 96ms (60% faster)

   ii. Application benchmarks: render times for repo directory (>1000 files, [gh/gh#241090](https://github.com/github/github/pull/241090))
   with primer/react Box: 3800ms
   with custom css: 3076ms (20% faster)

2. Slow server side rendering

   Some applications are able to make up for slower initial render times by collecting styles on the server first. In the correct stack, collecting styles requires rendering the app twice before we can ship any html to the user.

   benchmarks: in the issues-app experiment, collecting styles on the server contributed to + 20% of rendering time (450ms on top of 1900ms)

3. Style updates are expensive

   The slowest part of the current stack is updating styles based on props or state. Big changes take linearly longer, worse on slower devices.

   Benchmarks:

   i. Lab benchmarks: updating a page with 1000 components, static runtime css vs. dynamic runtime css (thanks @mattcosta7 for these!)

   re-rendering components with fixed styles on runtime: 242ms
   re-rendering components with dynamic styles on runtime: 441ms (55% slower)

   ii. Application benchmarks: opting out of IconButton for PR diff view (>500 files, [gh/gh#243269](https://github.com/github/github/pull/243269))

   dynamic styles with sx prop: 400ms
   dynamic styles with .css files: 165ms (60% faster)

The other reasons for change are to utilise css variables for theming and improve the guardrails of consuming primer/primitives","## Decision 
## Decision

- Transition from runtime injected CSS to static CSS files to improve performance:
  - Initial page load times are reduced by parallelizing CSS loading, avoiding unstyled content during JavaScript bundle processing.
  - Server-side rendering becomes faster by eliminating the need for double rendering to collect styles.
  - Style updates are more efficient, especially on slower devices, by avoiding runtime style computations.

- Utilize CSS variables to enable efficient theming and consistency across the application.

- Improve the consumer experience of `primer/primitives` by enforcing stricter guardrails through static styling.","## Decisions

1. Manually refactor styles to css files + css modules

   Use css variables from primer/primitives for inexpensive theming support, especially with server side rendering

2. Use css modules with hash

   By importing styles in the component, we can create an explicit dependency between the two. This enables applications using primer to have control over bundling and delivery.

   To begin with, we will ship a single css bundle that can be imported in the application. (example: `import '@primer/react/styles.css'`). When needed, we have the option to delegate bundling of css files to the application (they can be split by page or bundled as a common chunk for all react pages to share)

3. Keep styled-components underneath for supporting sx prop.

   Keep backward compatibility, we might change this in the future

Code example:

```jsx
import clsx from 'clsx'
import classNames from './ActionList.module.css'

const Button = ({className, sx, ...props}}) => {
  return (
    <Box
      as=""button""
      sx={sx}
      // it's important to pass both internal and props.className to the element
      className={clsx(classNames.ActionList, className)}
      {...props}
    >
    </Box>
  )
}
```"

> **Note**
> This ADR supercedes [`ADR 009`](./adr-009-interaction-tests.md)

We author tests using a combination of Jest and Playwright. Typically, Jest is
used for unit and integration tests and Playwright is used for Visual Regression
Tests against our Storybook.

In `ADR 009`, we proposed using Storybook's [`play`
functions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function) as
the recommended way to author tests that require tests based on user
interactions. In this ADR, we would like to revisit this decision.","## Decision 
## Decision

We decide to deprecate the use of Storybook's `play` functions for user interaction tests. Instead, user interaction tests will be written using Jest for unit and integration testing, and Playwright will be utilized for visual regression and end-to-end testing. This separation allows clearer test responsibilities, better tooling support, and improved test maintainability.","## Decision

For tests involving interaction, use Playwright to visit a storybook story and
interact with the component directly. This will allow for easy integration with
Visual Regression Testing and our automated accessibility testing (through axe).
In order to perform interactions, use [actions from
Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/input)."
"## Context

There are situations where a component prop can support a value or a ""responsive
value"" that results in the value changing depending on the viewport size. For
example:

```tsx
// Value
<Stack gap=""condensed"" />

// Responsive value
<Stack gap={{ narrow: 'condensed', regular: 'normal', wide: 'spacious' />
```

Typically, a responsive value will support all of our named breakpoints: narrow,
regular, and wide. Authors can use a hook called `useResponsiveValue` to support
resolving the value of a prop based on the current viewport size. The
implementation of this hook uses [`matchMedia`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia)
which, unfortunately, has a downside: the value of a prop may shift when the
component is server-side rendered. If the prop is used for styles or layout, then this will lead to a layout shift
when the component hydrates and the viewport size is different than the fallback
size on the server.

As a result, we would like to offer a paved path for providing responsive props
in a way tha twill not lead to layout shift during server-side rendering.","## Decision 
## Decision
To avoid layout shifts during server-side rendering when using responsive prop values, we will introduce a convention for specifying a stable fallback value for responsive props. This fallback value represents the value that will be rendered on the server and will match the value for the most common or smallest breakpoint to minimize layout shift on hydration.

The API for responsive props will look like this:

```tsx
<Stack gap={{
  fallback: 'condensed', // fallback value used on the server
  narrow: 'condensed',
  regular: 'normal',
  wide: 'spacious'
}} />
```

The `useResponsiveValue` hook will use the `fallback` value during server rendering and will resolve the actual viewport-specific value client-side once hydration happens.

This approach ensures that:

- The server-rendered output is stable and matches the initial client-rendered state as closely as possible.
- Authors have a clear, explicit way to provide a responsive prop without causing layout shifts.
- The system maintains full responsive behavior on the client side after hydration.

We will update documentation and tooling to encourage usage of the `fallback` prop for all responsive value props to ensure consistent application of this pattern.","## Decision

Authors should use data attributes to bridge between responsive values in
JavaScript and the corresponding styles in CSS. Authors should avoid using
JavaScript-driven mechanisms for controlling responsive values in order to
prevent layout shift during SSR.

For example, consider a `Stack` component that has a `gap` prop. This prop can
receive a plain value or one that is a responsive value. To support this,
authors should use the following patterns:

```tsx
type GapScale = 'none' | 'condensed' | 'normal' | 'spacious'

type StackProps = React.PropsWithChildren<{
  // Responsive props should be a union of the value of the prop plus
  // `ResponsiveValue` over that value
  gap?: GapScale | ResponsiveValue<GapScale>
}>

function Stack({children, gap}: StackProps) {
  // The `getResponsiveAttributes` helper is useful for adding the corresponding
  // `data-*` attributes to the container for the compnoent.
  //
  // In this case, it will add `data-gap` and `data-gap-{breakpoint}` attributes
  // with the corresponding value set
  return <StyledStack {...getResponsiveAttributes('gap', gap)}>{children}</StyledStack>
}

const StyledStack = styled.div`
  &[data-gap='none'],
  &[data-gap-narrow='none'] {
    /* ... */
  }

  &[data-gap='condensed'],
  &[data-gap-narrow='condensed'] {
    /* ... */
  }

  /* ... */

  // @custom-media --viewportRange-regular
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    &[data-gap-regular='none'] {
      /* ... */
    }

    &[data-gap-regular='condensed'] {
      /* ... */
    }

    /* ... */
  }

  // @custom-media --viewportRange-wide
  @media (min-width: 1400px) {
    &[data-gap-wide='none'] {
      /* ... */
    }

    &[data-gap-wide='condensed'] {
      /* ... */
    }

    /* ... */
  }
`
```

By default, this approach uses the following conventions:

- Props which may have responsive values should have a value that is
  serializable, ideally as a `string` or `boolean`
- Props will be provided on the component as a data attribute, using the format:
  `data-{propName}`
- For responsive values, the breakpoint name will be appended to the data
  attribute name specified above. For example: `data-{propName}-{breakpoint}`

Data attributes will act as a bridge between JavaScript and CSS. In CSS, authors
should use these data attributes to apply styles based on the value of the
attribute per-breakpoint.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a utility named `getResponsiveAttributes` that can be used to generate
> the corresponding `data-*` attributes for the props which may have responsive
> values."
"## Context

There are times when a prop is deprecated in favor of a more accessible API or a more flexible prop that can support a wider range of values. In these cases, we want to provide a clear path for authors to migrate from the deprecated prop to the new API.

For
example:

```tsx
// old API
<ActionList>
  <ActionList.Group title=""Group title"">
    <ActionList.Item>Item 1</ActionList.Item>
    <ActionList.Item>Item 2</ActionList.Item>
  </ActionList.Group>
</ActionList>

```tsx
// new API
<ActionList>
  <ActionList.Group>
    <ActionList.GroupHeading as=""h2"">Group title</ActionList.GroupHeading>
    <ActionList.Item>Item 1</ActionList.Item>
    <ActionList.Item>Item 2</ActionList.Item>
  </ActionList.Group>
</ActionList>
```","## Decision 
## Decision

To manage deprecation of props in favor of more accessible or flexible APIs, we will provide a clear migration path by:

- Introducing new props or components that offer enhanced accessibility and flexibility.
- Keeping the deprecated props functional but marked clearly with documentation and runtime warnings, if possible.
- Providing examples and guides showing how to migrate from the old API to the new one.
- Encouraging authors to adopt the new API by documenting benefits like improved accessibility.
- Removing the deprecated props in a future major version, following semantic versioning rules, to ensure backward compatibility during the transition.

For example, replacing a group title prop with a dedicated `GroupHeading` component allows more semantic and accessible markup while maintaining backward compatibility during the transition.","## Decision

1. Add the `@deprecated` TS notice, if possible, to the corresponding type
2. Mark the prop as deprecated in the component's documentation
3. Add an eslint rule or extend an existing one to warn against using the deprecated prop
4. Update the `primer/react` eslint plugin at github/github and evaluate the impact of the deprecation
5. If the change is minimal and safe, proceed with the auto fix of the eslint rule and create PRs by codeowners
6. If the change is large, add an eslint disable to each instance of the deprecated prop at github/github and make sure they show up on the accessibility score cards so that we can track the usage of the deprecated prop
7. Enable the eslint rule afterwards in github/github so that the new instances of the deprecated prop are heavily discouraged"
"## Context

- Proxy support is required for some enterprises and organizations to start using their own self-hosted runners
- While there is not a standard convention, many applications support setting proxies via the environment variables `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `no_proxy`, such as curl, wget, perl, python, docker, git, and R
  - Some of these applications use `HTTPS_PROXY` versus `https_proxy`, but most understand or primarily support the lowercase variant","## Decision 
## Decision

To support proxy configuration for self-hosted runners in enterprise environments, we will adopt the widely used convention of leveraging environment variables for proxy settings. Specifically:

- The runner will read and respect the following lowercase environment variables if they are set: `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy`.
- We will ensure compatibility primarily with these lowercase variants as they are supported by the majority of applications.
- Uppercase variants such as `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` will not be supported initially, to avoid ambiguity and maintain consistency with the common standard.
- Documentation will clearly specify these environment variables as the supported method for proxy configuration.
- This approach enables seamless integration with existing enterprise proxy setups without introducing custom configuration parameters.","## Decision

We will update the Runner to use the conventional environment variables for proxies: `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` if they are set.
These are described in detail below:
- `https_proxy` a proxy URL for all https traffic. It may contain basic authentication credentials. For example:
  - http://proxy.com
  - http://127.0.0.1:8080
  - http://user:password@proxy.com
- `http_proxy` a proxy URL for all http traffic. It may contain basic authentication credentials. For example:
  - http://proxy.com
  - http://127.0.0.1:8080
  - http://user:password@proxy.com
- `no_proxy` a comma-separated list of hosts that should not use the proxy. An optional port may be specified. For example:
  - `google.com`
  - `yahoo.com:443`
  - `google.com,bing.com`

We won't use `http_proxy` for https traffic when `https_proxy` is not set, this behavior lines up with any libcurl based tools (curl, git) and wget.
Otherwise, action authors and workflow users need to adjust to differences between the runner proxy convention, and tools used by their actions and scripts.  

Example:  
  Customer sets `http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888` and configures the runner against `https://github.com/owner/repo`, with the `https_proxy` -> `http_proxy` fallback, the runner will connect to the server without any problem. However, if a user runs `git push` to `https://github.com/owner/repo`, `git` won't use the proxy since it requires `https_proxy` to be set for any https traffic.

> `golang`, `node.js`, and other dev tools from the Linux community use `http_proxy` for both http and https traffic based on my research.

A majority of our users are using Linux where these variables are commonly required to be set by various programs. By reading these values, we simplify the process for self-hosted runners to set up a proxy and expose it in a way users are already familiar with.

A password provided for a proxy will be masked in the logs.

We will support the lowercase and uppercase variants, with lowercase taking priority if both are set."
"## Context

Command echoing as a default behavior tends to clutter the user logs, so we want to swap to a system where users have to opt in to see this information.

Command outputs will still be echoed in the case there are any errors processing such commands. This is so the end user can have more context on why the command failed and help with troubleshooting.

Echo output in the user logs can be explicitly controlled by the new commands `::echo::on` and `::echo::off`. By default, echoing is enabled if `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret is enabled, otherwise echoing is disabled.","## Decision 
## Decision

Command echoing will be disabled by default to reduce clutter in user logs.

Users can explicitly enable or disable echoing using the commands `::echo::on` and `::echo::off`.

Echo output will always be enabled automatically if the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret is set.

Errors during command processing will cause outputs to be echoed regardless of the current echo setting, to assist with troubleshooting.","## Decision
- The only commands that currently echo output are
  - `remove-matcher`
  - `add-matcher`
  - `add-path`
- These will no longer echo the command, if processed successfully
- All commands echo the input when any of these conditions is fulfilled:
  1. When such commands fail with an error
  2. When `::echo::on` is set
  3. When the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` is set, and echoing hasn't been explicitly disabled with `::echo::off`
- There are a few commands that won't be echoed, even when echo is enabled. These are (as of 2019/11/04):
   - `add-mask`
   - `debug`
   - `warning`
   - `error`
- The three commands above will not echo, either because echoing the command would leak secrets (e.g. `add-mask`), or it would not add any additional troubleshooting information to the logs (e.g. `debug`). It's expected that future commands would follow these ""echo-suppressing"" guidelines as well. Echo-suppressed commands are still free to output other information to the logs, as deemed fit."

## Decision

We will extend the runner's `Set up job` step to include additional contextual information in its logs, such as OS and software details from the hosted image. This enhancement aims to improve transparency and debugging by providing clearer environment details at the start of each job. The extra information will be integrated in a structured, standardized format to maintain log readability and facilitate automated parsing when necessary.","## Decision

The runner will look for a file `.setup_info` under the runner's root directory, The file can be a JSON with a simple schema.
```json
[
  {
    ""group"": ""OS Detail"",
    ""detail"": ""........""
  },
  {
    ""group"": ""Software Detail"",
    ""detail"": ""........""
  }
]
```
The runner will use `::group` and `::endgroup` to fold all detail info into an expandable group.

Both [virtual-environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) and self-hosted runners can use this mechanism to add extra logging info to the `Set up job` step's log."

This ADR proposes adding `steps.<id>.outcome` and `steps.<id>.conclusion` to the steps context.

This allows downstream a step to run based on whether a previous step succeeded or failed.

Reminder, currently the steps contains `steps.<id>.outputs`.","## Decision 
## Decision Outcome

We will add `steps.<id>.outcome` and `steps.<id>.conclusion` fields to the steps context because:

- It enables downstream steps to conditionally execute based on the success or failure of previous steps.
- It improves workflow flexibility and clarity for step dependencies.
- The current `steps.<id>.outputs` only allows output data sharing but does not communicate execution status.
- This addition enhances control flow without impacting existing features.","## Decision

For steps that have completed, populate `steps.<id>.outcome` and `steps.<id>.conclusion` with one of the following values:

- `success`
- `failure`
- `cancelled`
- `skipped`

When a continue-on-error step fails, the outcome will be `failure` even though the final conclusion is `success`."

Since configuring self-hosted runners is commonly automated via scripts, the labels need to be able to be created during configuration.  The runner currently registers the built-in labels (os, arch) during registration but does not accept labels via command line args to extend the set registered.

This is another version of [ADR275](https://github.com/actions/runner/pull/275)","## Decision 
## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Implement label creation through API calls during runner configuration, because

- The runner currently does not support extending labels via command line arguments during registration.
- Automating self-hosted runner setup requires the ability to create custom labels programmatically.
- Using the API allows labels to be created and managed dynamically in scripts, aligning with automated configuration practices.
- This approach addresses the limitation noted in Issue https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/262 and builds upon the improvements introduced in [ADR275](https://github.com/actions/runner/pull/275).","## Decision

This ADR proposes that we add a `--labels` option to the `config`, which could be used to add custom additional labels to the configured runner.

For example, to add a single additional label the operator could run:
```bash
./config.sh --labels mylabel
```
> Note: the current runner command line parsing and envvar override algorithm only support a single argument (key).

This would add the label `mylabel` to the runner, and enable users to select the runner in their workflow using this label:
```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, mylabel]
```

To add multiple labels the operator could run:
```bash
./config.sh --labels mylabel,anotherlabel
```
> Note: the current runner command line parsing and envvar override algorithm only supports a single argument (key).

This would add the label `mylabel` and `anotherlabel` to the runner, and enable users to select the runner in their workflow using this label:
```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, mylabel, anotherlabel]
```

It would not be possible to remove labels from an existing runner using `config.sh`, instead labels would have to be removed using the GitHub UI.

The labels argument will split on commas, trim and discard empty strings.  That effectively means don't use commas in unattended config label names.  Alternatively, we could choose to escape commas but it's a nice to have."

SS?? fundamentally relies on a third-party provider service to authenticate requests (e.g. OAuth2

We will implement a retry and fallback mechanism to handle transient faults when communicating with third-party authentication providers in SS??. This mechanism will:

* Detect transient failures such as outages, timeouts, or rate limiting responses.

* Implement fallback strategies like circuit breakers to avoid overwhelming the provider during outages.
* Provide adequate logging and telemetry to monitor failure patterns and diagnose issues.

We implemented a generic `circuit.Breaker` type, which implements the ""Circuit Breaker"" design
pattern made popular by Michael T. Nygard's book, [""Release It!""](
https://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it). All requests to the provider service are issued through
a stateful `circuit.Breaker` instance, which tracks the frequency of request failures. When the
`Breaker` sees that enough requests are failing, it temporarily suspends all outgoing traffic to the
provider (i.e. ""enters `Open` state). After some time, the `Breaker` transitions to a `HalfOpen`
state, in which a limited number of outbound requests are allowed. If failures persist, then the
`Breaker` will once again suspend outbound traffic, re-enter `Open` state, and typically will wait
for a longer interval of time before trying again. If instead the `Breaker` observes that requests
are consistently succeeding, then it will resume all outbound traffic (i.e. enter `Closed` state).

lot of effort has been wasted related to this.

independently. This is vital for high availability/reliability and security.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will adopt the Discovery v5 protocol for peer discovery in our messaging app. 

This approach eliminates the reliance on hardcoded peers, allowing dynamic peer discovery and better scalability as the number of active users grows.

Adopting Discovery v5 enables the system to independently scale server peers, enhancing high availability, reliability, and security.

Implementation will follow the specifications outlined in the Discovery v5 protocol:
- https://ideas.status.im/ideas/092-disc-v5-research
- https://github.com/fjl/p2p-drafts/blob/master/discv5-eip.md

This decision supports a more resilient and extensible network topology for messaging peers.","## Decision

- Use and enable Discovery v5 for all networks
- Do this before beta is released

This means we have capacity to achieve 5000+ DAU / 500 concurrent connection. It
seems unlikely we can do so with reliable messaging in the current setup.

Trade-off for this is:
- Uncertainty in introducing a new protocol leading to possible delays
- Possible increase in CPU/Network (we can disable protocol once peers are found though)"

Idea [142-Wallet-Compatibility](https://ideas.status.im/ideas/142-wallet-compatibility/README) changes the way we generate keys starting from the 12 mnemonic words.

This change allows users to create a wallet in other apps and import the same address in Status using the 12 mnemonic words.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will adopt the BIP32/BIP39/BIP44 standard HD key derivation method for generating keys from a 12-word mnemonic seed phrase. This approach aligns our key derivation process with widely used wallet standards, facilitating wallet compatibility and interoperability.

By implementing this standard, users will be able to create wallets in external applications that follow BIP44 and import the same addresses into Status using their existing 12-word mnemonic phrases.

Specifically, the SDK will:

- Use BIP39 to convert the mnemonic to a seed.
- Use BIP32 to derive hierarchical keys from the seed.
- Use the BIP44 path `m/44'/<coin_type>'/0'/0/0` (where `<coin_type>` is the Cosmos coin type as per SLIP-44) for derivation of the account key.
- Generate the public/private keypair from the derived key to produce the address.

This change improves interoperability with a wide range of wallets and aligns with common blockchain industry standards. It does not affect existing addresses generated by prior methods, so existing wallets will not be broken by this update.","## Decision

* update the BIP39 seed generation to use the salt `""mnemonic""` instead of `""status-im""` following [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki#from-mnemonic-to-seed).

* update the master key generation using the constant `""Bitcoin seed""` instead of `""status-im""`, following [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki#master-key-generation).

* remove the use of the password in the salt during the BIP39 seed generation (password is not removed from the app in general, and it's still required to encrypt the keys on the device)."
"## Context

On the path to releasing a usable beta we've faced a variety of performance
issues:

- https://github.com/status-im/ideas/issues/55
- https://ideas.status.im/ideas/071-low-traffic
- https://ideas.status.im/ideas/076-smooth-ui
- https://ideas.status.im/ideas/083-energy-efficient

Some of these performance issues are related to the use of LES, especially on
Mainnet. Examples of problems include: slow/hot sync, disk filling up, bandwidth
usage, etc. This can partly be remedied by the use of CHT to speed up sync
(https://github.com/status-im/status-go/wiki/Updating-CHT-BloomTrie).

In order to simplify the problem, we decided earlier this year to not spend too
much time looking into performance improvements related to LES, instead focusing
our efforts on improving the performance on Whisper and in client-side code.

This also means we don't have a full picture of to what extent LES is a
performance bottleneck for the Status app. It is possible proper use of CHT,
slowing sync down, vary load depending on if you are on WiFi or not, etc, can
solve these problems. However, the consensus right now is that ULC is the more
promising route to take.

However, since ULC isn't ready yet, this means we are relying on Infura. This
is a bad idea from a decentralization and security point of view. This can be
partly remedied by allowing the user to run an upstream node. It is still a bad
trust model, relying on third-party Ethereum nodes, and we want to get away
from this as soon as possible.

With ULC it is possible to connect to more than one node, which increases
decentralization and security.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will continue to prioritize development and optimization of the ULC (Ultra Light Client) implementation as the primary solution for improving performance and decentralization in the Status app.

In the interim, until ULC is ready:
- We will rely on Infura as the default upstream node provider, recognizing the inherent tradeoffs in centralization and trust.
- We will provide an option for users to configure and run their own upstream Ethereum nodes to mitigate reliance on third parties.
- We will apply partial remedies such as using CHTs to speed up sync, adjusting sync load based on connectivity (e.g., WiFi), and other incremental improvements to LES to alleviate major performance issues without exhaustive optimization efforts.

This approach balances current technical limitations, security and decentralization goals, and practical constraints while paving the path toward adopting ULC for more robust, decentralized, and performant operation.","## Decision

1. Rely on upstream nodes for beta. For the closed beta scheduled to be releases
Q2 we will provide two ways of accessing the Ethereum network:

- Upstream RPC with Infura (default)
- Custom upstream node (https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/3994)

From a decentralization point of view we need the latter before we can release
the beta.

2. ULC MVP. Additionally, as soon as beta is released, assess and start to
   introduce ULC as an experimental non-default mode in the app.
   
By doing this we also support the network, since it is still a very new
protocol. ULC requires trusted peers to operate, and right now trust is
established by config (list of trusted peers).

Initially we could hardcode these nodes, with option to add your own. Later on
we can have some form of distributed directory with a rating system. This also
likely requires merging ULC upstream, so we aren't the only ones running trusted
nodes.

3. LES track (optional). If we still have resources and there's interest,
optionally run a parallel track to clean up LES usage (update CHT, cluster) and
understand exact performance impact and viablity of running LES on
resource-constrained devices.

These three decisions balances the following trade-offs:

- get a usable beta released as soon as possible
- provide users with options to get minimal amount of decentralization
- pave the way for trustless usage by default (ULC/LES node)"
"## Context

We have some data that we don't want to appear in the logs (user passwords are
a good example). Currently, they are passed around as strings, that could be
printed out by mistake in a log entry (see https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/4053)","## Decision 
## Decision

We will introduce a new type, called `SensitiveString`, to encapsulate sensitive data such as passwords. This type will behave like a string in all respects except:

- It will override the `String()` and `GoString()` methods to return a redacted placeholder (e.g., `<redacted>`) instead of the actual content.

- It will implement logging interface hooks to ensure that when logged, the sensitive data is not printed.

- Internally, the actual string value can be accessed explicitly by methods designed for that purpose, preventing accidental exposure in logs.

By wrapping sensitive data in `SensitiveString`, developers are forced to treat these values carefully. Logging frameworks will recognize `SensitiveString` and redact the output automatically.

This approach balances safety and usability, ensuring sensitive strings are not inadvertently logged while maintaining operability.","## Decision

To minimize the risk of leaking passwords through logs, we should not pass
passwords as strings in our codebase. We introduced a new type `MaskedData` in
`status-im.utils.security`.
update (16-Dec-2022) `status-im.utils.security` is now moved over to `utils.security.core` 

We use `(security/mask-data <data to hide>` to wrap sensitive data into this
type and then use `(security/unmask <masked-data>)` to get the plaintext back.

It is important to keep that sensitive data masked as much as possible, until
you need the plaintext to pass to the extenral APIs.

Example:
```clojure
(println (security/mask-data ""my-plaintext-password"")) ;; Outputs ""******""
(println (security/unmask (security/mask-data ""my-plaintext-password""))) ;; Outputs ""my-plaintext-password""
```"
"## Context

Originally, we supported 3rd party status extensions in form of javascript jailed execution environment (eq Jail) + small js library exposing chat commands API to js code.

While neat in theory, it has some serious downsides:

- Design of the API was quite poor, preferring mutable semantics over stateless API leveraging strength of the host application (cljs/re-frame).
  As a result of that, more dynamic/state requiring things (like the live tx detail in `/send` command messages) were very hard to do,
  so instead of ""eating our own dogfood"", we decided to side-step the API and implement such things as hard-coded logic in the app, while partly
  retaining the js code for ""easier"" things (like parameter declaration).
  Needles to say, such efforts produced code of very poor quality, riddling our app with hard-coded ""magic"" everywhere in the codebase, completely
  defeating the point of ""dogfooding"" while still requiring more effort and being much more error prone (no way to unit test jail logic) because 
  of the need to asynchronously communicate with jail for leftover logic in command messages (the parts not hardcoded in app).
  
- We were in a state where there was not even one command defined completely in jail, with all of them requiring custom hardcoded logic in app to
  actually work.
  Due to numerous changes and rush to get things working, half of the API was obsolete and was not working/working differently then described in
  the API documentation.
  
- We are quite tight stretched regarding performance and the Jail didn't particularly help with that - whenever some command message was defined in
  Jail, it required constant RN Bridge ""ping-pong"" whenever sending the message or receiving the message, eating more resources + breaking otherwise
  quite simple logic into harder to reason asynchronous call chains (execute method defined in Jail, wait for the result, execute next method in Jail...).
  
- Till now, there was no real interest in 3rd party bots anyway - the only ""real"" DAPPs submitted to status were ""normal"" DAPPs utilising just the `web3.js`
  API and built on top of regular web technologies, so they could be ran in any Ethereum client like Metamask or Mist, besides Status.
  
- There is a very promising new concept of extensions (project pluto), which will enable to extend status with much nicer and declarative extension
  definitions.
  Such extensions will not be able to only hook-in into the command messages logic, but also other application (host) hooks, like wallet assets/collectibles,
  chat contacts, etc.","## Decision 
## Decision

We decided to **deprecate the existing javascript jailed execution environment (Jail) for 3rd party status extensions** due to the following:

- The API design favored mutable semantics causing complexity and poor code quality when trying to implement dynamic/stateful features.
- No commands were fully implemented within Jail; all required hardcoded logic in the host app, undermining the purpose of the Jail.
- Obsolete and inconsistent API implementations created confusion and maintenance burden.
- Performance issues due to frequent asynchronous communication with Jail leading to inefficient resource use and complicated logic.
- Lack of real adoption of 3rd party bots within Jail; most extensions use standard web3.js DAPPs running independently.
- The emergence of the new extensions model (Project Pluto) promises more declarative, powerful, and integrated extension capabilities beyond just command messages, including hooks into other app features.

Therefore, we will move forward by **phasing out the Jail** in favor of the new extensions framework, focusing development efforts on the Pluto extensions system which offers a more maintainable, performant, and expressive approach to extending Status functionalities.","## Decision

In the light of points above, we decided to remove Jail and `Status.js` API from the application and re-work command messages in set of nicely
encapsulated app level protocols, so command related logic will be defined in one place, commands will be able to leverage strength of our platform
and development of any new functionality related to them will be much faster and more pleasant. 
We will address the 3rd party code issue separately by extensions."
"## Context

The whitepaper describes Tribute to Talk (TtT) as an economics-based anti-spam filter for receiving messages and ""cold"" contact requests from user. Stakeholders would stake a minimum amount of SNT that another Status stakeholder must deposit in order to contact him directly.
The whitepaper also proposes that the deposit is only forfeited to the recipient if he replies.","## Decision
## Decision

We will implement Tribute to Talk (TtT) as an anti-spam economic filter by requiring senders to stake a minimum
amount of SNT as a deposit before sending messages or contact requests to a recipient. The deposit will only be
forfeited to the recipient if the recipient replies to the sender, incentivizing meaningful interactions while filtering
spam.

This design choice ensures that recipients are protected from unsolicited messages and cold contact requests, while
still enabling communication between stakeholders. The staking requirement dynamically aligns incentives and reduces
spam by imposing an economic cost on message senders.","## Decision

Considering:
- the absence of efficient ways to perform anonymous transactions (zk-snarks could be used in the future for that)
- the impossibility to prove that a recipient has made an actual reply and not some kind of automated reply (captcha solution was proposed, but wouldn't be practical until we can use a solution such as swarm feeds that allow users to make free updates to their captcha without on-chain transactions)
- the limited time to develop the feature

We opted for a solution that:
- doesn't establish a direct correlation between the tribute payment and an on-chain transaction, so it
- uses regular transactions for tributes payment, giving users plausible deniability about the nature of the payment
- doesn't store tribute information on-chain"

This decentralization of responsibilities aims to enhance accountability and address polishness issues identified by the design team effectively.","## Decision

The decision is to create an additional role within the mobile development team for each section. The individuals selected for these roles will have the following responsibilities:

- Ensure GitHub issues are created for new features/designs of the section.
- Ensure issues are adequately described and linked as best as possible.
- Ensure issues have a grooming session where other developers can provide their feedback before working on the set of issues.
- Ensure all relevant parties are invited, such as designers, QA, Product Owner, leads, etc., as needed (including the designer who created the feature).
- Ensure there is consensus among the developers working on the section about the decided strategy approach. Ideally, this consensus should be documented.
- Ensure UI quality by organizing designer reviews and guaranteeing pixel perfection.
- Ensure overall implementation is satisfactory based on the predefined requirements.
- Ensure alignment between desktop, web, and mobile versions for the respective section in collaboration with the mobile developers and design team.
- Act as a point of contact for the design team with respect to the section.
- Ensure that someone goes through the designs once they are created with the respective designer.
- Assist the design team with technical feasibility analysis and address any product concerns.
- Facilitate the growth of the next team member into the role.

The people identified for each sections are as follow:

- Messaging @flexsurfer, followed by @alwx
- Syncing & Onboarding @siddarthkay
- Communities @ilmotta, followed by @ajayesivan
- Activity Center & Shell @J-Son89, followed by @Parveshdhull
- Wallet (once the vertical team is created) @J-Son89, followed by @briansztamfater

This will be a rotating post, every 4 months it will go to the next in line.

The wallet team might have longer times for rotation, as stability might be more important. That's still to be decided.

During the development of a new Sylius API (based on API Platform) for Product Options, we had to decide how we should handle
Product Option's values collection, to make it efficient and easy to use.","## Decision 
## Decision

We decided to represent Product Option's values collection as a dedicated subresource in the Sylius API.

This approach offers the following benefits:

* Efficient handling and retrieval of values without loading the entire Product Option entity.
* Simplifies the management of values through clear API endpoints dedicated to the collection.
* Aligns with API Platform best practices and RESTful principles.
* Facilitates future extensibility and maintenance.","## Decision and reasoning

Product option values should always be provided with their IRIs. They can exist outside of the `ProductOption` resource 
(e.g. be [related with](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Component/Product/Model/ProductVariant.php#L44) `ProductVariant`).
Moreover, values embedded together with their translations in the `ProductOption` that already has its translations would
result in a massive and unmanageable response."
"## Context and Problem Statement

A big chunk of resources available in Sylius have some part locale aware. Product descriptions, names of payment or shipping methods
should be translated to the customer to provide the best user experience. Right now most of the resources are returned with 
all available translations in the store and proper localization of content is left to the frontend developers. What is more,
this solution is not consistent, as some endpoints already embeds some part of translatables in them. We should provide clear,
easy to use and consistent way of handling customer locales.","## Decision 
## Decision

To provide a consistent and clear way of handling customer locales in Sylius resources, we will standardize the localization approach across all APIs.

1. All locale-aware resource fields (e.g., product descriptions, payment and shipping method names) will return only the translation matching the customer's requested locale by default.
2. The frontend will be responsible for providing the customer's locale preference via request parameters or headers.
3. Endpoints that currently embed multiple translations will be refactored to return only the relevant localized content to reduce payload size and improve clarity.
4. An explicit option will be provided (e.g., query parameter) for clients to request all available translations when needed.
5. Documentation will be updated to reflect the standardized localization approach, simplifying frontend integration and ensuring consistency.

This approach improves user experience by delivering content in the customer's language and reduces ambiguity in API responses.","## Decision Outcome

The first approach should be used in admin section of API, while the third one should be used in shop section. This way, we
will receive best of both worlds with the minimal effort. It is worth mentioning that Sylius have two distinguish entry points
to API - admin and shop. They are concerned about different things and resolves different problems. Unified view of a product
in the shop will make it easy and straightforward to build product pages. At the same time all translation approach should be used in
admin to provide full control over ""translation"" resource - as we should treat them. Therefore, every resource translation
should be linked to the main resource through IRI. Each of these translation resource may be a subject of all CRUD operations
accessible throughout HTTP Verbs."

To detect pull request changes, we can use webhooks or polling using GitHub's
API.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will use GitHub webhooks to detect pull request changes.

Rationale:

- Webhooks provide near real-time notifications of pull request events.
- Polling the GitHub API is less efficient, introduces latency, and increases API usage.
- Webhooks offer a scalable and event-driven mechanism aligning better with modern CI/CD practices.","## Decision

We decided to start with polling for security reasons. Using webhooks would require users to
open an ingress to the cluster. Because of this requirement, we think security conscious folks may refuse to roll this out on production clusters especially in an
air-gapped environment. This does not mean that we will never consider using webhooks for this, but that initially, polling is what we have chosen to implement.

The Branch-Based Planner has two components:

1. Polling Server: Detect Pull Request changes and manage Teraform resource
   state.
2. Informer: Make a comment when new plan output is available."
"## Context

Like [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/), the tf-controller API has a handful
of places where it accepts cross-namespace references.

 - `Terraform.spec.sourceRef` -- refers to the Flux source object with
   the Terraform program
 - `Terraform.spec.dependsOn[]` -- refers to other objects that must
   be ready before this object can be run
 - `.data.resources[]` -- in the config struct used by the branch
   planner

In general in Kubernetes, references to objects in other namespaces
are frowned upon, because

 - they break namespace isolation assurances; and,
 - they encourage the proliferation of permissions.

Both of these effects make a system less secure.

However: removing cross-namespace refs entirely would break some
installations in a way that would be difficult to fix, because Flux
deployments often rely on defining sources away from objects that use
them.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will continue to support cross-namespace references in the API in the short term to maintain compatibility with existing Flux-based installations.

However, we recognize the security and isolation concerns these references pose. Therefore:

- We will clearly document the risks associated with cross-namespace references in the API docs to inform users.

- We will discourage their use in new deployments, promoting same-namespace references whenever possible.

- We will design future API versions to phase out or restrict cross-namespace references, aiming to improve security and namespace isolation.

- We will explore alternative mechanisms, such as explicit delegation or scoped permissions, to support cross-namespace workflows securely.

By balancing backward compatibility with a clear path towards improved security and namespace isolation, we provide users time to transition while encouraging best practices.","## Decision

Deny cross-namespace references by default, but allow them to be
enabled with a flag.

So that the default value means the right thing, the flag name must be
`enable-cross-namespace-refs`, and the default `false`. To avoid
confusion when people try to use the Flux version of this flag
`--disable-cross-namespace-refs`, it should be supported too, but only
respected if supplied."
"## Context

The TF-Controller currently faces challenges related to the deletion of Terraform resources.
These problems span across three categories:

1. Single object deletion,
2. Resources with dependencies deletion, and
3. Namespace deletion.

These problems must be fixed in the above order as (2) and (3) require single object deletion to be resolved first.

Deleting a single TF object can sometimes be obstructed because it's tied to other resources like Source objects, Secrets, and ConfigMaps. If we try to remove it without deleting these resources, the TF object gets stuck in an inconsistent state, making it harder for users to manage their infrastructure smoothly.
Therefore, the TF-Controller is being enhanced to address this problem more efficiently, using the contents of generated Workspace BLOBs. Each BLOB contains all necessary information from the associated Source, Secrets, and ConfigMaps to ensure that TF-Controller finalization procedures can delete objects correctly.

Currently, the TF-Controller downloads a Source BLOB and pushes it to a tf-runner. The tf-runner processes this BLOB to create a Workspace file system. It generates a backend configuration file, variable files, and other necessary files for the Workspace file system, using data from associated Secrets and ConfigMaps. This newly created Workspace file system is then compressed, sent back to the TF-Controller, and stored as a Workspace BLOB in the controller's storage.
A caching mechanism for these BLOBs is essential to fixing the single TF object deletion process.","## Decision 
## Decision

We decide to implement a caching mechanism for Workspace BLOBs in the TF-Controller to enable reliable and consistent deletion of single Terraform resources.

The cache will store the Workspace BLOBs created by the tf-runner, containing all necessary context from associated Source, Secrets, and ConfigMaps. This cached data will allow the TF-Controller finalization logic to access complete resource metadata without having to re-fetch or reconstruct it, ensuring that dependencies can be correctly identified and deleted.

By caching Workspace BLOBs:

- Single TF objects can be deleted by the controller with full knowledge of resource dependencies.
- Deletion operations become consistent, reducing stuck states caused by dangling dependent resources.
- Subsequent deletion of resource dependencies (step 2) and namespace-wide deletions (step 3) will be made feasible as they build upon reliable single object deletion.

This approach leverages the existing mechanism of tf-runner workspace creation and compressing the Workspace file system, ensuring that the TF-Controller has robust access to all relevant deletion data at finalization time.","## Decision

1. **BLOB Creation and Storage**
   * A gRPC function named `CreateWorkspaceBlob` will be invoked by the TF-Controller 
     to tell tf-runner to compress the Workspace file system into a tar.gz BLOB, which is then retrieved back to the controller.
   * The caching mechanism will be executed right before the Terraform Initialization step, ensuring that the latest and most relevant data is used.
   * Each Workspace Blob will be cached on the TF-Controller's local disk, using the UUID of the Terraform object as the filename,`${uuid}.tar.gz`.
   * To reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the cache entries, and cache collisions, the cache file will be deleted after the finalization process is complete.
2. **Persistence** 
   * [The persistence mechanism used by the Source Controller](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/configuration/vertical-scaling/#persistent-storage-for-flux-internal-artifacts) will be adopted for the TF-Controller's persistence volume.
3. **BLOB Encryption**
   * The encryption and decryption of the BLOBs will be tasked to the runner, with the controller solely responsible for storing encrypted BLOBs.
   * Each namespace will require a service account, preferably named ""tf-runner"".
   * The token of this service account, which is natively supported by Kubernetes, will serve as the most appropriate encryption key because it's stored in a Secret, access to which can be controlled by RBAC. Storing it in a Secret also allows the key to be rotated.
4. **Security Measures (Based on STRIDE Analysis)**
   * **Spoofing:** Implement Kubernetes RBAC for access restrictions and use mutual authentication for gRPC communications.
   * **Tampering:** Use checksums for integrity verification and 0600 permissions to write-protect local disk storage.
   * **Repudiation:** Ensure strong logging and auditing mechanisms for tracking activities.
   * **Information Disclosure:** Utilize robust encryption algorithms, rotate encryption keys periodically, and secure service account tokens.
   * **Denial of Service:** Monitor storage space and automate cleanup processes.
   * **Elevation of Privilege:** Minimize permissions associated with service account tokens.
5. **First MVP & Future Planning**
   * For the initial MVP, the default pod local volume will be used.
   * Since a controller restart will erase the BLOB cache, consideration for using persistent volumes should be made for subsequent versions."

In previous releases of Zarf, the creation of the initialization package at the core of many of our E2E tests required repository secrets to login to registry1. Since this is an open-source project, anyone could submit a change to one of our GitHub workflows that could steal our secrets. In order to protect our secrets from any bad-actors we used [peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch@v2](https://github.com/peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch) so that only a maintainer would have the ability to run the E2E tests when a PR is submitted for review.

In the current version of Zarf (v0.15) images from registry1 are no longer needed to create the zarf-init-{{arch}}.tar.zst. This means, given our current span of E2E tests, we no longer need to use repository secrets when running tests. This gives us the ability to reassess the way we do our E2E testing.

When considering how to handle the tests, some of the important additions we were considering were:
  1. Ability to test against different kubernetes distributions
  2. Ability to test against different linux distributions
  3. Ability to run (at least some of) the E2E tests locally without relying on an ec2 instance - for quicker feedback loops when developing new features","## Decision 
## Decision

Given the removal of the need for repository secrets in creating the initialization package, we will:

1. Remove the requirement that only maintainers can trigger E2E tests via slash commands, allowing E2E tests to run automatically on PRs without manual intervention.
2. Enhance E2E testing framework to support testing against multiple Kubernetes distributions and multiple Linux distributions to improve coverage and reliability.
3. Modify the E2E test setup to enable running a subset of tests locally without needing an EC2 instance, to provide faster feedback loops during development.
4. Continue to maintain security by ensuring no secrets are exposed or used in the E2E tests or workflows.
5. Update documentation and workflows to reflect these changes to the E2E testing process.","## Decision

The previous E2E test code was not extensible enough to be reused to test Zarf against different kubernetes distributions. The test suite was refactored so that we could write a setup and teardown function for each kubernetes distribution we wanted to verify against and the test suite was then responsible for cycling through the different distributions. This gives us the ability to test multiple kubernetes distributions against the same exact test cases.

The individual test cases were also rewritten to not rely on terratest running a bash command over ssh. Instead, the test uses the locally built Zarf binary and example packages to validate expected behavior. This approach works both on local dev machines (linux/mac) and on the Ubuntu GitHub Runner that gets triggered when a pull request is created. This also has the positive side effect of not needing to wait several minutes for an ec2 instance to spin up for testing.

Since we no longer need repository secrets to run the E2E tests, we removed the requirement for a maintainer to use a `/test all` chatops command to dispatch the tests. Instead, there is a new test workflow defined for each kubernetes distribution we are verifying against and the tests get run automatically whenever a PR is created or updated.

When looking back at the list of 'important additions' we were considering above. All three are addressed with this approach. Testing against different kubernetes distributions is as simple as defining how to create and destroy the cluster. All of the test cases are runnable locally and then because of that testing on a linux distribution is possible by just switching over to another machine and running the same `make test-e2e` there. This also gives us the ability to test against cloud distributions like EKS!

In order to create any workloads in K8s, an image has to exist on the node or be pulled in from an OCI Distribution server (docker registry). Local K8s distros such as KIND, K3D, K3S, Microk8s have CLI support for injecting or pushing images into the CRIs of cluster nodes. No standard or tool exists to do this generically in K8s as the CRI sits outside the problem of K8s beyond just communicating with it. For Zarf to push images into a K8s cluster that does not have a CLI option to inject the image, we have to establish some mechanism to create a temporary registry, use an existing one, or inject the image in the cluster. Zarf must also support unknown environments with no other dependencies; we cannot assume a registry exists. Typically when K8s pulls images from a remote registry, it sends the request to the CRI that then does the pull outside of the K8s context. The CRI runs at the host level on a per-node basis, so to access a private registry, the TLS trust needs to be modified on any host/node that would attempt to pull the image. The two primary ways to do this are modifying the node's root certificate authorities or the CRIs configuration if it has an option for TLS root CA. Lastly, as this is per node, all nodes in the cluster would need to be modified or some affinity/taint to force the pod to use a single node during bootstrapping.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will implement support in Zarf to handle image distribution into Kubernetes clusters without relying on native CLI injection capabilities or existing container registries. Specifically:

- For clusters lacking CLI support to inject images into CRI, Zarf will deploy a temporary local container registry inside the cluster to host the required images.
- If a registry already exists and is accessible, Zarf will leverage it instead of deploying a new one.
- Zarf will not assume the presence of a registry; it will operate in air-gapped or unknown environments without external dependencies.
- To address the need for TLS trust by the CRI on each cluster node, Zarf will facilitate modifications of root certificate authorities or configuration of CRI TLS roots, depending on cluster capabilities, ensuring all nodes trust the registry serving the images.
- If modifying all nodes is not feasible, Zarf will provide mechanisms (e.g., affinity or taints) to schedule pods on nodes with proper image access.
  
This approach ensures robust and portable image management across diverse Kubernetes environments, including edge and air-gapped clusters.","## Decision

Because we cannot require third-party dependencies, the requirement from some cloud-managed or distro-managed registry is not an option as not every K8s cluster will have that available.  Running an in-memory registry while zarf is performing `zarf init` was initially explored to resolve the external dependency issue.  However, this solution proved too complex when dealing with network traversal (especially behind NATs), firewall, and NACL rulesets.  Additionally, because of the complexities around TLS trust, the in-memory registry was not a viable solution.

After iterating on several solutions, including `kubectl cp`, `kubectl exec`, a busybox configmap injection that brought in netcat to stream files, and a few variations on those ideas, we found using only configmaps to be the most predictable method for injection. The challenge with this mode is that the ETCD limit is 1 MB total, with binary data base64-encoded leaving roughly 670 KBs of data per configmap, far too small to bring the registry tarball in a single configmap. So instead, we used a combination of a custom Rust binary compiled with MUSL to perform file concatenation, untarring, and verification of a set of split tarball chunks across a variable number of configmaps. We found that chunking by less than the near-maximum configmap size was more performant on some resource-constrained control planes. The details of this solution and a drawing are located in the main README of this repo."

SBOM are required for software running on government hardware per EO14028.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will integrate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation process into our build and release pipeline to comply with EO14028 requirements for software running on government hardware.

Key points of the decision:

- Adopt widely accepted SBOM standards such as SPDX or CycloneDX for SBOM format to ensure interoperability and compliance.

- Use automated tools to generate SBOMs during the build process, ensuring accuracy and minimizing manual effort. Examples include Syft or SPDX tooling.

- The SBOM will list all dependencies, including transitive ones, along with versions and licenses, to provide full transparency.

- SBOMs will be stored securely and distributed alongside software artifacts to allow downstream auditing and verification.

- Update documentation to inform consumers about SBOM availability and usage.

- Continuously maintain and update SBOMs with each software release to ensure ongoing compliance.

This approach ensures compliance with EO14028 while maintaining automation and transparency in software supply chain security.","## Decision

Using Witness' Syft attestor functionality allows Zarf to continue to get more refined SBOM capabilities as Witness' capabilities expand over time. Syft is capable of finding installed packages and some binaries for statically compiled dependencies over each image within a Zarf package. This allows for SBOMs for each image to be generated and packaged along with the Zarf package.  Abilities to export the SBOM to SDPX and CycloneDX formatted documents as well as a browse-able web page are in works."
"## Context

Currently Zarf leverages [Helm Post Rendering](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/advanced/#post-rendering) to mutate image paths and secrets for K8s to use the internal [Zarf Registry](../packages/zarf-registry/). This works well for simple K8s deployments where Zarf is performing the actual manifest apply but fails when using a secondary gitops tools suchs as [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), etc. At that point, Zarf is unable to provide mutation and it is dependent on the package author to do the mutations themselves using rudimentary templating. Further, this issue also exists when for CRDs that references the [git server](../packages/gitea/). A `zarf prepare` command was added previously to make this less painful, but it still requires additional burden on package authors to do something we are able to prescribe in code.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will replace the current Helm Post Rendering based mutation approach with a dedicated mutation step integrated into the Zarf workflow.

Key points of the decision:

- Introduce a built-in mutation mechanism in Zarf that applies image path and secret substitutions during the package preparation phase.
- This mutation step will operate independently of Helm's post-rendering, enabling mutation before GitOps tools like Flux or ArgoCD consume the manifests.
- The new mutation approach will also handle CRDs referencing the Git server, ensuring consistent image and secret references.
- This alleviates the burden on package authors, removing the need for rudimentary templating or manual mutation.
- The existing `zarf prepare` command will be enhanced to perform comprehensive mutation automatically.
- Overall, this improves consistency, maintainability, and compatibility with GitOps workflows.","## Decision

A [mutating webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/) is standard practice in K8s and there [are a lot of them](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#what-does-each-admission-controller-do). Using the normal Zarf component structure and deployment strategy we can leverage a mutating webhook to perform automatic imagePullSecret binding and image path updates as well as add additional as-needed mutations such as updating the [GitRepository](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/source/gitrepositories/) CRD with the appropriate secret and custom URL for the git server if someone is using Flux."
"## Context

In ADR 3, the decision was made to create a rust binary (`stage1`) that would re-assemble a `registry:2` image and a go registry binary (`stage2`) from a series of configmaps. While this solution works, it is overkill for the operations that `stage2` performs. The `stage2` binary is only responsible for 1. starting a docker registry in `rw` mode, 2. pushing the `registry:2` crane tarball into said registry, 3. starting the docker registry in `r` mode. This `registry:2` image is then immediately consumed by the `zarf-registry` package, creating a true in-cluster docker registry. The injector pod is then destroyed. The overhead this operation creates:

- having to keep track of another binary (making the total number 3 for the zarf ecosystem)
- nearly doubling the amount of configmaps loaded into the cluster (makes init slower)
- having to compile the binary for each platform (adds to the build time + ci)
- using a full-featured docker registry to host a single image (wasteful)","## Decision 
## Decision

We will remove the `stage1` rust binary and replace it with a lightweight shell script or minimal program that performs the necessary operations of `stage2` (starting the docker registry in rw mode, pushing the `registry:2` crane tarball, then restarting in r mode).

This reduces operational overhead by eliminating an extra binary, decreases configmap usage, shortens build and CI times, and avoids using an oversized full-featured registry image unnecessarily.","## Decision

The rust binary is already being injected via configmap and unpacking the tarball. There is little need to bring everything but the kitchen sink to just serve a single image. Therefore the decision is to use the rust binary to perform the entire injection process. This required a few changes to the rust binary:

- not only re-assemble + unpack the tarball, but also unpack the `registry:2` image (stored as a [crane tarball format](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/pkg/v1/tarball))
- transform the `registry:2` crane manifest to a docker v2 manifest
- spin up an HTTP server compliant with the v2 docker registry API to serve the `registry:2` image"

There are sections of the code that are not easily able to be tested by our end-to-end testing and now that Zarf is moving into being a library for other products there will be more scrutiny around our defined interfaces.  This ADR explores ways that we could adjust our testing strategy to address these concerns.

Potential considerations:

1. Introduce Unit-Testing Zarf-wide
    Pros:
        - More of the codebase is covered with tests and will force us to take more consideration when updating it
    Cons:
        - As the codebase evolves the efficacy of these tests is likely to go down, especially if they are written to the code rather than the interface

2. Introduce Unit Testing in a defined and limited capacity within Zarf
    Pros:
        - A decent amount of the codebase will be tested (specifically we can target those areas difficult to e2e test)
        - We can be picky about what/where we unit test so that the maintenance burden of the tests is not too high
    Cons:
        - We will need to be vigilant when PRs come through with Unit Tests that these are correct applications of them

3. Introduce Integration Testing or partial End-to-End testing
    Pros:
        - This is closer to how we already test within Zarf
    Cons:
        - These can be relatively complex to orchestrate and maintain over time requiring complex mocks or other mechanisms to make them work","## Decision 
## Decision

We will introduce unit testing in a defined and limited capacity within Zarf.

Rationale:

* This approach allows us to target specific areas of the codebase that are difficult to cover with end-to-end tests, improving coverage where it matters most.
* It balances the benefits of increased test coverage with manageable maintenance overhead, avoiding widespread tests that may become brittle as the code evolves.
* We will establish guidelines and review processes to ensure that unit tests added in PRs are appropriate, focused, and maintainable.
* Integration and full end-to-end tests will continue to be used for broader coverage, given their complexity and maintenance cost.","## Decision

It was decided to introduce a limited set of unit tests to the Zarf codebase (2) because this will enable us the most flexibility and control over how we test while also allowing us to specifically target specific units without a ton of overhead.  Specifically we will ask the following before implementing a Unit Test:

1. Is what I want to test a true unit (i.e. a single function or file)?
2. Does what I want to test have a clearly defined interface (i.e. a public specification)?
3. Is this code inside of the `src/pkg` folder or should it be?"

Images are not the only way that dependencies can be brought in via a Zarf package (our own init package has two components that are not images yet could have vulnerabilities within them, k3s and the injector).  We should SBOM these in addition to images so that we are providing a more complete picture to our users.

Potential considerations:

1. Run Syft against the entire zarf temp build directory
    Pros:
        - This would provide the most information for what _might_ be in a Zarf package
    Cons:
        - If git repos are brought in you could catch many index files that are actually not in the package but are dependencies of the repos leading to confusion

2. Run Syft against files and dataInjections
    Pros:
        - We know these files are actually inside of the package and won't just be noise
        - This is the most common two ways for people to include additional artifacts in packages (we use files in our own init package)
    Cons:
        - This is only a subset of what Zarf provides and someone could commit an artifact to a git repo for example

3. Allow user flexibility in what gets SBOMed
    Pros:
        - This provides the user the most flexibility
    Cons:
        - This could be complex to get right on implementation and if it were optional may be a forgotten feature by most users","## Decision 
## Decision

We will implement approach 2: Run Syft against files and dataInjections inside the Zarf package.

This approach provides the best balance between accuracy and relevance, ensuring that only artifacts definitely included in the package are scanned without introducing noise from external git repositories. It aligns with common use cases, including our own init package, and delivers actionable SBOM data to users.

We will revisit support for more flexible or broader SBOM generation in future iterations if user demand arises, to keep the current implementation straightforward and maintainable.","## Decision

It was decided that we would SBOM the files and dataInjections inclusions by component (2) and include them into our SBOM viewer that way.  This will allow us to characterize what SBOMing in Zarf may look like going forward without introducing something that is just optional or that might make too much noise at first blush."
"## Context

Zarf was rooted in the idea of declarative K8s deployments for disconnected environments. Many of the design decisions made in Zarf are based on this idea. However, in certain connected environments, Zarf can still be leveraged as a way to define declarative deployments and upgrades without the constraints of disconnected environments. To that end, providing a declarative way to deploy Zarf packages without the need for a Zarf init package would be useful in such environments.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will support a declarative deployment method for Zarf packages that does not require a Zarf init package, enabling deployments in connected environments. This approach will allow users to define and apply deployments and upgrades declaratively using standard Kubernetes manifests or package definitions, leveraging Zarf’s existing capabilities where possible but without the constraints imposed by disconnected scenarios.

Because disconnected environment constraints such as offline bundle initialization do not apply here, the system will permit direct application of package manifests and automated upgrades, making it simpler and more flexible for connected environments while preserving the core Zarf design principles.","## Decision

YOLO mode is an optional boolean config set in the `metadata` section of the Zarf package manifest. Setting `metadata.yolo=true` will deploy the Zarf package ""as is"" without needing the Zarf state to exist or the Zarf Agent mutating webhook. Zarf packages with YOLO mode enabled are not allowed to specify components with container images or Git repos and validation will prevent the package from being created."
"## Context

Originally, the `scripts` noun was added to components to allow us to move hard-coded init business logic out of the codebase and into the package system. At the time there was only a `before` and `after` section with simply an array entry per command. Later, `prepare` was added as a way to do something during `zarf package create`. As teams began to find new ways to use the capabilities, their limitations became more obvious.","## Decision 
## Decision

We decided to evolve the `scripts` noun in components by introducing a more structured and extensible approach:

- Replace the simple array entries with a defined set of lifecycle hooks such as `before`, `prepare`, `after`, and potentially others as needed, each explicitly named and documented.
- Allow each hook to define multiple named scripts with clear execution order and context.
- Support parameterization and conditional execution of scripts to increase flexibility.
- Maintain backward compatibility by supporting the existing simple array syntax, but encourage migration to the new structured format.
- Document the new design thoroughly to help teams leverage the enhanced capabilities and avoid past limitations.

This decision ensures the `scripts` noun can accommodate growing use cases and provides a clear, maintainable pattern for extending initialization and packaging logic in components.","## Decision

The `scripts` section of the `zarf.yaml` will be replaced with a new `actions` section. The `actions` section will be a map of action names to a list of commands to run. `actions` will contain `action sets` that map to the following lifecycle events:

- `onCreate` - Runs during `zarf package create`
- `onDeploy` - Runs during `zarf package deploy`
- `onRemove` - Runs during `zarf package remove`

In addition to adding more lifecycle events, the `actions` section will also allow for more complex actions to be defined. New configurations include, setting the cmd directory, defining custom env variables, setting the number of retries, setting the max total seconds, muting the output, and [setting a variable](../docs/3-create-a-zarf-package/7-component-actions.md#creating-dynamic-variables-from-actions) to be used in other actions or components.

Further details can be found in the `component-actions` [component actions documentation](../docs/3-create-a-zarf-package/7-component-actions.md), [package create lifecycle documentation](../docs/3-create-a-zarf-package/5-package-create-lifecycle.md), [package deploy lifecycle documentation](../docs/4-deploy-a-zarf-package/1-package-deploy-lifecycle.md), and the [example package](../examples/component-actions/README.md)."
"## Context

There has been a long-standing usability gap with Zarf when doing local development due to a lack of local image support. A solution was merged in, [#1173](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/pull/1173), and released in [v0.23.4](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/releases/tag/v0.23.4) to support this feature. Unfortunately, we didn't realize there is a [glaring issue](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/1214) with the implementation that causes Zarf to crash when trying to load large images into the local docker daemon.  The docker daemon support in Crane is somewhat naive and can send a machine into an OOM condition due to how the tar stream is loaded into memory from the docker save action. Crane does have an option to avoid this issue, but at the cost of being much slower to load images from docker.

We did extensive investigation into various strategies of loading docker images from the daemon including: crane, skopeo, the docker go client and executing the docker cli directly with varying levels of success. Unfortunately, some of the methods that did work well were up to 3 times slower than the current implementation, though they avoided the OOM issue. Lastly, the docker daemon save operations directly still ended up being slower than crane and docker produced a legacy format that would cause issues with [future package schema changes](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/1319) we are planning for oci imports.

## Decision

Given the trade-offs between performance and stability when loading large Docker images locally with Zarf, we will continue to use Crane for image loading despite its occasional out-of-memory (OOM) issues. Crane currently provides the best performance and compatibility with our future OCI package schema changes.

To mitigate the OOM crashes caused by Crane’s naïve tar streaming, we will:

- Monitor user reports and crash metrics to identify and understand OOM occurrences.
- Investigate enabling Crane’s slower but more memory-efficient loading option as a fallback when large images cause OOM issues.
- Explore improvements in the Crane integration or alternative implementations in the future to balance performance and reliability.
- Avoid switching to Docker’s native save/load or other tooling that produce legacy formats or significantly increase load times.

This approach prioritizes maintaining fast local development workflows while acknowledging current limitations and planning ongoing improvements.","## Decision

We had hoped to leverage docker caching and avoid crane caching more, but realized that caching was still occurring via Syft for SBOM. Additionally, the extremely-large, local-only image is actually the edge case here and we created a recommended workaround in the FAQs as well as an inline alert when a large docker image is detected. This restores behavior to what it was before the docker daemon support was added, but with the added benefit of being able to load images from the docker daemon when they are available locally."
"## Context

One primary application component that end users of Zarf are deploying is [Big Bang](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang). The installation of Big Bang is complicated for several reasons:

- It requires Flux to be installed to deploy correctly due to the use of Flux CRDs.
- The [images](https://umbrella-bigbang-releases.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/umbrella/1.51.0/package-images.yaml) defined within Big Bang are normally a superset of the images needed for any individual deployment.
- All images that Big Bang might need takes 10s of gigabytes of storage to include in a Zarf package.
- The git repositories defined within Big Bang are normally a superset of the git repositories needed for any individual deployment.
- Injecting a `values.yaml` file into the [default deployment structure](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/blob/master/base/kustomization.yaml) is complicated and the discovery of which images are needed is a function of the values that are provided to the Big Bang chart","## Decision 
## Decision

To address the complexity of deploying Big Bang with Zarf, the following decisions were made:

1. **Modular Packaging of Images and Repositories:** Instead of including the entire superset of images and git repositories in a single Zarf package, create multiple modular packages that each contain only the images and repositories relevant to specific deployment use cases. This reduces storage requirements and allows users to select only what they need.

2. **Dynamic Values Injection Support:** Provide tooling or mechanisms within Zarf to programmatically inject or override `values.yaml` files into Big Bang's default deployment structure during package creation or deployment. This supports accurate discovery of required images based on deployment configuration.

3. **Flux Dependency Handling:** Ensure that Flux is either pre-installed or included as a dependency package that can be installed prior to deploying Big Bang, to satisfy its CRD prerequisites.

4. **Configuration-driven Deployment:** Encourage the use of standardized deployment configurations that identify which images and repositories are necessary, allowing Zarf packaging and deployment processes to tailor the included components effectively.

This approach balances storage efficiency, ease of deployment, and flexibility by enabling deployment customization and managing dependencies explicitly.","## Decision

Deployments of Big Bang can be managed with a new `bigbang` noun in the zarf.yaml that manages the complexity of the deployment. This capability will take the values provided to the big bang chart, template them during the package phase to identify which [Big Bang packages](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/blob/master/docs/packages.md) are being configured in the Zarf package. The code then includes only the git repositories and images needed for the configured packages, and does not include the git repositories and images for packages that would not be deployed.

The `bigbang` section will provide the following configurations for managing a big bang deployment:

- `version` - Identifies the particular version of Big Bang to deploy, which corresponds to git tags in the provided `repo`. See versions of Big Bang [here](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/releases).
- `repo` - Identifies the git repository Big Bang is hosted on. Defaults to https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang.git
- `valuesFiles` - list of local files that get passed to the Big Bang helm chart for deployment.
- `skipFlux` - boolean to determine if the flux installation for Big Bang should be skipped. Only set this to true if flux has been deployed in a different way already in the cluster."

Zarf packages are currently only available if built locally or through manual file transfers. This is not a scalable way to distribute packages. We wanted to find a way to distribute and publish packages in a way that is easily consumable for the majority of users. When considering the goal of being able to share packages, security and trust are very important considerations. We wanted our publishing solution and architecture changes to keep in mind signing of packages and the ability to verify the integrity of packages.

We know we are successful when:

1. (Priority) Users can use Zarf to natively publish a Zarf package to an OCI compliant registry
2. (Secondary goal) Package creators can sign Zarf packages to enable package deployers can trust a packages supply chain security","## Decision 
## Decision

We will implement native support in Zarf for publishing and pulling packages directly to and from OCI compliant registries. This will enable seamless distribution and consumption of Zarf packages by the majority of users without relying on local builds or manual file transfers.

To address security and trust, we will integrate package signing capabilities that allow package creators to sign Zarf packages using cryptographic signatures. Package deployers will then be able to verify the integrity and authenticity of packages prior to deployment, enhancing supply chain security.

This approach prioritizes OCI registry compatibility for ease of use while ensuring robust security measures through package signing and verification features.","## Decision

"## Context

Zarf currently supports git servers and container registries within the airgap to host dependencies for applications, and while this works well for most production deployments, it doesn't cater as well to airgap development where you may need artifacts and libraries for various coding languages to compile and develop software.  Zarf's support of `git` is also somewhat lacking in that it only supports flux `GitRepository` objects and does not support more generic use cases where clients try to reach out to upstream `git` hosts in a more native way.","## Decision 
## Decision

- Extend Zarf to better support airgap development environments by including local artifact repositories and package registries for various programming languages, enabling developers to fetch dependencies required for compiling and developing software within the airgap.

- Enhance Zarf's git support beyond Flux `GitRepository` objects to accommodate generic upstream git interactions, allowing more native git usage patterns inside airgapped environments.

- Maintain Zarf's current capabilities for production deployment use cases while expanding its flexibility for development workflows inside airgaps.","## Decision

Since we already had an artifact registry available to us in Gitea, it was decided to utilize that as the default provider for this functionality in addition to matching the external support for `git` and `registry` servers with a new `artifact` server specification on `init`.  From here, to access the configured server we had two main options:

1. Transform any artifact references statically (i.e. swap upstream URLs in build scripts before bringing them into the environment)
2. Transform any artifact references dynamically (i.e. swap upstream URLs in an active proxy that any build scripts could pickup through DNS)

It was decided to go with #2 since this would allow us to support a wider array of build technologies (including those that wrap existing commands like Buck/Bazel/Make) as well as support builds that may be coming from resources not brought in by Zarf.  This allows for more flexibility in how Zarf could transform URLs while allowing these commands to run as they would on the internet side without any modification."

Eventually, Zarf needs to become a ""Generally Available"" v1.x.x product that people can rely on for mission-critical operations.  Today, Zarf can be used in these environments; though, it requires someone more involved in the Zarf lifecycle than a normal consumer/user to make that successful due to the regular introduction of breaking changes and the lack of testing in certain areas.","## Decision 
## Decision

To transition Zarf to a stable, Generally Available (GA) v1.x.x release suitable for mission-critical operations, we will adopt the following measures:

- Establish a formal release process that includes clear versioning, changelogs, and adherence to semantic versioning to minimize breaking changes within minor releases.

- Implement comprehensive testing coverage across all critical areas of the product to detect regressions and ensure stability.

- Enhance documentation to support users with clear upgrade paths, usage guides, and operational best practices.

- Introduce a user-friendly lifecycle management approach that reduces the need for deep involvement in upgrade and maintenance tasks by normal consumers.

- Prioritize backward compatibility and support deprecation notices in advance to give users time to adapt.","## Decision

To make Zarf a Generally Available product we need to focus on overall stability and mechanisms to ensure long-term stability.  ""Stability,"" in this case, is both that of the features we release and of the APIs and schemas we present to Zarf consumers.

To increase this stability, we decided to implement the following:

- [ ] Mechanism/branching strategy to backport patch fixes to older minor releases
- [x] Clear definition of `released`, `beta`, and `alpha` features, including a matrix of their support across OSes
- [ ] Clear definition of when backward compatibility checks are going to be removed with clear messaging to users
- [ ] End to End testing that covers the `released` features outlined in that feature matrix - this should also be done:
  - across operating systems (specifically: Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - across major k8s distros (specifically: K3d, K3s, Minikube, Kind, EKS, AKS, OpenShift)
  - across registry providers (specifically: Docker Distribution, ECR, ACR)
  - across git providers (specifically: Gitea, GitLab)
- [ ] Unit testing that covers our library code (`src/pkg`) for people using Zarf as a library (code coverage metric TBD)
- [ ] Mechanisms and tests to not break compatibility with packages built with older versions of Zarf
- [ ] Mechanisms to notify users when they may need to upgrade the Zarf Agent (or Pepr capability)
- [ ] Mechanisms to ensure users can easily access documentation specific to the version of Zarf they use
- [ ] Mechanisms to ensure a more seamless Zarf install experience (i.e., macOS binary signing, `sudo apk add zarf`, `asdf install zarf X.X.X`)
- [ ] Regularly published/maintained example package(s) for tutorials/quick install
- [ ] Clear definition/strategy for ""what Zarf is"" including clear docs on how to use `released` features

"## Context

The idea of `hooks` is to provide a way for cluster maintainers to register functionality that runs during the deployment lifecycle. Zarf packages already have the concept of `actions` that can execute commands on the host machine's shell during certain package lifecycle events. As `actions` gain more adoption, the team has noticed they are being used to add functionality to Zarf in unexpected ways. We want `actions` to be a tool that extends upon the functionality of Zarf and its packages, not a tool that works around missing or clunky functionality.

We want package creators to be able to create system agnostic packages by leveraging core Zarf functionality. The following is one such scenario:

- _IF_ ECR is chosen as the external registry during `zarf init` / cluster creation, _THEN_ Zarf will seamlessly leverage ECR without requiring advanced user effort.

Using ECR as a remote registry creates 2 problems that Zarf will need to solve:

 1. ECR authentication tokens expire after 12 hours and need to be refreshed. This means the cluster will need to constantly be refreshing its tokens and the user deploying packages will need to make sure they have a valid token.
 2. ECR Image Repositories do not support 'push-to-create'. This means we will need to explicitly create an image repository for every image that is being pushed within the Zarf package.

Packages that get deployed onto a cluster initialized with ECR as its remote registry will need to make sure it solves these 2 problems.

Currently there are 2 solutions:

1. The package deployer solves the problem pre-deployment (creating needed repos, secrets, etc...)
2. The package itself solves these problems with `actions` that are custom built for ECR clusters.

Neither one of these current solutions are ideal. We don't want to require overly complex external + prior actions for Zarf package deployments, and we don't want package creators to have to create and distribute packages that are specific to ECR.

Potential considerations:","## Decision 
## Decision

We will introduce a first-class `hooks` mechanism in Zarf to handle cluster-specific operational concerns like ECR integration.

1. **Purpose**: `hooks` will provide a structured way for cluster maintainers to register lifecycle functionality that transparently handles cluster-specific requirements (e.g., ECR token refresh, repository creation) without burdening package creators or deployers.

2. **Separation from Actions**: Unlike `actions`, which are package-scoped and designed for extending package functionality, `hooks` will be cluster-scoped and managed by cluster maintainers. This separation will prevent misuse of `actions` as workarounds for missing core functionality.

3. **ECR Integration Example**: If ECR is selected as the external registry during `zarf init`, hook implementations will:
   - Automatically refresh ECR authentication tokens as required, ensuring uninterrupted push/pull operations.
   - Automatically create necessary ECR image repositories before package images are pushed, solving the 'push-to-create' limitation transparently.

4. **User Experience**: By embedding this logic within hooks managed at the cluster level, packages remain system-agnostic and deploy seamlessly on clusters regardless of whether they use ECR or another registry.

5. **Implementation**: Hooks will be registered and executed at appropriate stages in the deployment lifecycle, ensuring that cluster-specific prerequisites and maintenance actions are handled automatically.

This approach improves maintainability, robustness, and user-friendliness by centralizing cluster-specific logic outside of individual packages or deploy-time manual steps.","## Decision

[Pepr](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/pepr) will be used to enable custom, or environment-specific, automation tasks to be integrated in the Zarf package deployment lifecycle. Pepr also allows the Zarf codebase to remain agnostic to any third-party APIs or dependencies that may be used.

A `--skip-webhooks` flag has been added to `zarf package deploy` to allow users to opt out of Zarf checking and waiting for any webhooks to complete during package deployments."
"## Context

We need a way to decouple transformations from Zarf. We know the Zarf transformation library is battle tested, hardened, and reliable. As Pepr takes admission responsibilities from the Zarf Agent, we need a way to synchronize the TypeScript with the Go code instead of maintaining two disparate libraries which will be expected to grow.

We considered:

- WASM
- gRPC
- REST
- Rewrite the code in TypeScript","## Decision 
## Decision

We will use WASM to decouple transformations from Zarf.

Rationale:

- WASM allows us to reuse the battle-tested Go transformation library directly in the TypeScript environment, avoiding duplication of logic.
- It enables synchronization between the TypeScript and Go codebases by using a shared compiled artifact instead of maintaining two separate implementations.
- WASM provides better performance and tighter coupling than gRPC or REST for this use case.
- Rewriting the Go code in TypeScript is undesirable due to the effort involved and potential for divergence.

Therefore, compiling the Go transformation library to WASM and integrating it into Pepr's TypeScript code is the chosen path.","## Decision

We conformed around using WASM because we can leverage the battle tested transform library from Zarf without incurring network overhead cost from pod to pod or container to container communications."
"## Context

Zarf natively supports creating the following package sources:

- Local Tarball (`.tar` and `.tar.zst`)
  - Via `zarf package create <dir> -o <dir>`, with compression determined by `metadata.uncompressed` in `zarf.yaml`
- Split Tarball (`.part...`)
  - Via `zarf package create <dir> --max-package-size <size> -o <dir>`
- OCI package (`oci://`)
  - Via `zarf package publish <source> oci://` or `zarf package create <dir> -o oci://...`
- In-cluster (Deployed) package
  - Post `zarf package deploy <source>` the package is show in `zarf package list`

However, the current loading abilities of Zarf have been inconsistent depending upon the action specified. For example:

- Split tarball packages could be created, deployed, but not inspected, or removed
- In-cluster packages could be removed (by name), but not inspected
- HTTPs URLs could be deployed, but not inspected, or removed
- etc...","## Decision 
## Decision

We will unify and extend the loading capabilities of Zarf packages so that all package sources are consistently supported across all package actions, including creation, deployment, inspection, and removal.

Specifically:
- Implement consistent handling for split tarball packages to support inspection and removal in addition to creation and deployment.
- Add inspection support for in-cluster (deployed) packages alongside their current removal capability.
- Enable inspection and removal capabilities for HTTP(s) URL-based packages, currently only deployable.
- Define a clear and extensible architecture for package source handling to avoid future inconsistencies.
- Ensure appropriate validation and error handling across all package sources and actions.
- Update documentation to reflect the consistent behavior and supported actions for each package source type.

This decision ensures Zarf provides a predictable, robust, and comprehensive package management experience across all supported package sources and actions.","## Decision

Zarf must support the `deploy`, `inspect`, `remove`, `publish`, `pull`, and `mirror-resources` commands across package sources.

For common behavior to be exhibited by all sources, the `PackageSource` interface has been introduced along with the `layout` library.

```go
// src/pkg/packager/sources/new.go

// PackageSource is an interface for package sources.
//
// While this interface defines three functions, LoadPackage, LoadPackageMetadata, and Collect; only one of them should be used within a packager function.
//
// These functions currently do not promise repeatability due to the side effect nature of loading a package.
type PackageSource interface {
    // LoadPackage loads a package from a source.
    //
    // For the default sources included in Zarf, package integrity (checksums, signatures, etc.) is validated during this function
    // and expects the package structure to follow the default Zarf package structure.
    //
    // If your package does not follow the default Zarf package structure, you will need to implement your own source.
    LoadPackage(*layout.PackagePaths) error
    // LoadPackageMetadata loads a package's metadata from a source.
    //
    // This function follows the same principles as LoadPackage, with a few exceptions:
    //
    // - Package integrity validation will display a warning instead of returning an error if
    //   the package is signed but no public key is provided. This is to allow for the inspection and removal of packages
    //   that are signed but the user does not have the public key for.
    LoadPackageMetadata(dst *layout.PackagePaths, wantSBOM bool, skipValidation bool) error

    // Collect relocates a package from its source to a tarball in a given destination directory.
    Collect(destinationDirectory string) (tarball string, err error)
}
```

The following sources have been implemented:

- Local Tarball (`.tar` and `.tar.zst`)
- Split Tarball (`.part...`)
- HTTP(S) URL
- Published OCI package (`oci://`)
- In-cluster (Deployed) package (`inspect` and `remove` only)

The `layout` library contains the `PackagePaths` struct which supersedes the prior `TempPaths` struct. This new struct contains access methods to different aspects of Zarf's internal package layout. This struct is passed to the `PackageSource` functions to allow for the loading of packages into the correct layout. In order for a package to be loaded into the correct layout, the package must follow the default Zarf package structure, or be converted to the expected structure during loading operations."
"## Context

Zarf has supports composing components together between packages on `zarf package create` since v0.16.0.  This has allowed package creators to make more complex packages from smaller reusable bits.  As this functionality grew however there were a few problems that developed:

1. Import chains did not handle scaling to larger numbers of layers with test coverage usually only covering the first import.
2. When OCI skeletons were added they were largely bolted on after the fact without rethinking how they would impact composability.
3. Component filtering via the `only` filter was not implemented in a central location leading to bugs with create-time filters.","## Decision 
## Decision

To address these composability problems in Zarf packages, we will redesign the package composition system by:

1. Centralizing the component filtering logic to ensure consistent and bug-free filtering at create-time.
2. Refactoring import chain handling to better scale with deeper import layers, including improved testing coverage across all layers.
3. Integrating OCI skeleton support natively into the composition framework instead of as an afterthought, to better support composability and maintainability.

This redesign ensures the composability system is robust, scalable, and maintainable going forward.","## Decision

We decided to separate composability into its own package that represents a composability import chain as a doubly linked list.  This allows us to represent the whole chain as it exists relative to the ""head"" Zarf package (the definition that Zarf was asked to build) to more easily handle packages that are in different locations (such as OCI skeletons in one's cache).  We also run the compose functions on all components so that the additional filter logic that is needed for these components can be handled more concisely and built upon (as it might for `flavor` https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/2101)."

> Feature request: <https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/2169>

The current package development lifecycle is:

1. Create a `zarf.yaml` file and add components
2. Create a package with `zarf package create <dir>`
3. Debug any create errors and resolve by editing `zarf.yaml` and repeating step 2
4. Run `zarf init` to initialize the cluster
5. Deploy the package with `zarf package deploy <tarball>`
6. Debug any deploy errors and resolve by editing `zarf.yaml` and repeating step 2 or 5

If there are deployment errors, the common pattern is to reset the cluster (ex: `k3d cluster delete && k3d cluster create`) and repeat steps 4-6. Re-initializing the cluster, recreating the package, and redeploying the package is tedious and time consuming; especially when the package is large or the change was small.

`zarf package create` is designed around air-gapped environments where the package is created in one environment and deployed in another. Due to this architecture, a package's dependencies _must_ be retrieved and assembled _each_ and _every_ time.

There already exists the concept of [`YOLO` mode](0010-yolo-mode.md), which can build + deploy a package without the need for `zarf init`, and builds without fetching certain heavy dependencies (like Docker images). However, `YOLO` mode is not exposed via CLI flags, and is meant to develop and deploy packages in fully connected environments.","## Decision 
## Decision

To improve the development lifecycle and reduce the iteration time for package creation and deployment in connected environments, we will implement the following changes:

1. Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g., `--yolo`) to expose the existing `YOLO` mode functionality allowing users to build and deploy packages without running `zarf init` and without fetching heavy dependencies each time.
2. Optimize `zarf package create` to cache or reuse previously fetched dependencies as much as possible during the development cycle to avoid repeated heavy downloads.
3. Document the recommended workflow for package development in connected environments that encourages using the `--yolo` mode for rapid iteration, including building and deploying packages without repeatedly initializing or resetting clusters.
4. Maintain the existing `zarf package create` behavior for air-gapped environments to preserve functionality for disconnected use cases.
5. Provide guidance and tooling to reset or clean caches if necessary, so that end users can manually invalidate cached dependencies if required.

This decision will streamline package development and debugging by reducing redundant steps and making rapid iteration easier in fully connected environments while preserving support for air-gapped workflows.","## Decision

Introduce a `dev deploy` command that will combine the lifecycle of `package create` and `package deploy` into a single command. This command will:

- Not result in a re-usable tarball / OCI artifact
- Not have any interactive prompts
- Not require `zarf init` to be run by default (override-able with a CLI flag)
- Be able to create+deploy a package in either YOLO mode (default) or prod mode (exposed via a CLI flag)
- Only build + deploy components that _will_ be deployed (contrasting with `package create` which builds _all_ components regardless of whether they will be deployed)"

"## Context

Zarf is currently using an in-house built logging solution which in turn depends on pterm. This solution is used to output information to the end user who is using the Zarf CLI. This output is for the most part formatted with the purpose of CLI user experience. Logging function calls are done both in the CLI specific code as well as in the packages. The logging is implemented in such a way that different levels exist with different impacts and log destinations. A common pattern that is used is to call `message.Fatal` whenever an error occurs. This will output the message to STDERR while writing the actual error message to a debug log and exiting the program. Exiting the program in this manner makes unit testing difficult while also skipping proper context handling and skipping any clean-up that was intended to run before exiting the program. Some logging components like the progress bar and spinner are accessed through a shared global state that is not thread safe. The coupling to logging becomes complicated as disabling the progress bar is a challenge while multi threading these functions which access the global state resulting in complicated access patterns.","## Decision 
## Decision

We decide to refactor the Zarf logging solution to improve testability, concurrency, and separation of concerns:

* Replace all direct calls to `message.Fatal` and similar immediate-exit logging with error returns or panic recoveries to allow unit tests to execute fully and clean-up routines to run.
* Decouple the CLI user output formatting from the logging system. Introduce distinct interfaces for user-facing CLI messages (info, progress bars, spinners) and backend application logging (debug, error).
* Remove shared global state for progress bars and spinners. Instead, provide instances of these components passed explicitly or managed via context to ensure thread safety and easier disabling.
* Introduce structured logging where possible to separate log content from formatting and destinations, making it easier to direct logs to files, stdout, or debug logs selectively.
* Provide a controlled shutdown mechanism that handles error conditions gracefully without forcing the entire program to exit prematurely, ensuring proper context handling and resource cleanup.","## Decision

I am proposing to completely refactor the logging functionality to follow a more standardized format using the newish slog interfaces. On top of that we would refactor the current internationalization by converting them to standardized errors.

* Replace the message package with a slog interface.
* Replace the lang package with static errors.
* Remove any use of `message.Fatal` and instead return errors.
* Refactor use of `message.WarnErr` to either return error or to log the error.
* Refactor existing functions that print formatted outputs to defer the printing to the CLI.
* Define a new interface for spinner and progress bar that is passed in as a function parameter.

The message package currently exports the following functions which should be replaced by its logr counterpart.

| Function | Replacement | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ZarfCommand | Info | Just formats a slice as a command. |
| Command | Info | Outputs a command with a prefix and style. |
| Debug | Debug | |
| Debugf | Debug | |
| ErrorWebf | N/A | Not used anywhere. |
| Warn | Warn | |
| Warnf | Warn | |

| Fatalf | N/A | Should not be used. |
| Info | Info | |
| Infof | Info | |
| Success | Info | Seems to be a info log with a checkmark prefix. |
| Successf | Info | Seems to be a info log with a checkmark prefix. |
| Question | ? | Open question how to resolve this. |
| Questionf | ? | Open question how to resolve this. |
| Note | Info | Should just be an info or maybe a debug log. |
| Notef | Info | Should just be an info or maybe a debug log. |
| Title | ? | Not sure how this should be replaced as it formats with separator. |
| HeaderInfof | ? | |
| HorizontalRule | ? | |
| JSONValue | N/A | Should be replaced with a marshal. |
| Paragraph | ? | |
| Paragraphn | ? | |
| PrintDiff | ? | |
| Table | ? | Need to come up with a good syntax for functions to return output that can print as a table. |
| ColorWrap | ? | Should this be used? | 
| PrintConnectStringTable | N/A | This logic should not exist in the message package. |
| PrintCredentialTable | N/A | This logic should not exist in the message package. |
| PrintComponentCredential | N/A | This logic should not exist in the message package. |
| PrintCredentialUpdates | N/A | This logic should not exist in the message package. |
| Spinner | Interface | New Spinner interface. |
| ProgressBar | Interface | New progress bar interface. |

The majority of simple logging changes should be possible with little signature changes. Replacing the existing output with a slog interface would allow other implementations to be used. A challenge initially may be the changes to table output formatting to make it work properly. This change will require some refactoring of existing code. A requirement for the changes is that they have to improve the UX for users looking at log files. As I understand the present day the spinners will cause a new line everytime they update, resulting in a lot of bloat. A goal should be to make sure that this does not happen in the future.

Spinners and progress bars however are a bit more challenging. They need to be refactored so that they are no longer instantiated outside of the CLI code. They should instead be passed as a function parameter to each function that needs them. A good example of a project that solves the problem in a similar manner is Kind. In Kind they create a [status object from the logger](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/blob/7799e72306db315ea4f4b1cac90ff68404da4f28/pkg/internal/cli/status.go#L39) which they then [pass to where it is needed](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/blob/7799e72306db315ea4f4b1cac90ff68404da4f28/pkg/cluster/internal/create/create.go#L133). Doing so results in a single status object created which is reused where ever it is needed. A lot of inspiration can be take from how Kind deals with CLI output. While they use klog instead of slog there are a lot of similarities. They have for example a check if the output is in a terminal or not, and will disable the spinner accordingly. 

Here is a suggestion for how a thread safe spinner could be implemented with a shared logger. This also allows for parallel spinners and progress bars.

```golang

		log:      log,
		printer:  h.printer,
	}
}

func (s *Spinner) Update(status string) {
	s.mx.Lock()
	defer s.mx.Unlock()

	// Do not update if status is the same.
	if s.status == status {
		return
	}
	if s.firstStatus == """" {
		s.firstStatus = status
	}
	s.status = status

	// If no printer we log normally.
	if s.printer == nil {
		s.log.Info(status)
		return
	}

	// Create or update the spinner.
	if s.spinner == nil {
		spinner, _ := pterm.DefaultSpinner.WithWriter(s.printer.NewWriter()).WithSequence(s.sequence...).Start(status)
		s.spinner = spinner
		return
	}
	s.spinner.UpdateText(status)
}

func (s *Spinner) Fail() {
	s.mx.Lock()
	defer s.mx.Lock()

	if s.printer == nil {
		return
	}

	s.mx.Lock()
	defer s.mx.Unlock()

	if s.printer == nil {
		return
	}
	s.spinner.Success(s.firstStatus)
}
```

The work will most likely have to be split into a couple of steps.

1. Remove any use of message fatal.
2. Refactor table printing functions.
3. Replace message logging with a structured logger.
4. Replace spinner and progress bars."
"## Context

Zarf currently does not have explicit schema versions. Any schema changes are embedded into Zarf and can change with new versions. There are several examples of deprecated keys throughout Zarf's lifespan such as:

- `setVariable` deprecated in favor of `setVariables`
- `scripts` deprecated in favor of `actions`
- `group` deprecated in favor of `flavor`, however these work functionally different and cannot be automatically migrated
- `cosignKeyPath` deprecated in favor of specifying the key path at create time

Zarf has not disabled any deprecated keys thus far. On create the user is always warned when using a deprecated field, however the field still exists in the schema and functions properly. Some of the deprecated keys can be migrated automatically as the old item is a subset or directly related to it's replacement. For example, setVariable is automatically migrated to a single item list of setVariables. This migration occurs on the zarf.yaml fed into the package during package create, however the original field is not deleted from the packaged zarf.yaml because the Zarf binary used in the airgap or delivery environment is not assumed to have the new schema fields that the deprecated key was migrated to.

The release of v1 will provide an opportunity to delete deprecated features that Zarf has warned will be dropped in v1.

Creating a v1 schema will allow Zarf to establish a contract with it's user base that features will be supported long term. When a feature is deprecated in the v1 schema, it will remain usable in the schema for the lifetime of v1.","## Decision 
## Decision

With the release of v1, we will introduce an explicit schema versioning system for Zarf configurations. The v1 schema will establish a clear contract for users, ensuring stable long-term support for features included in this version.

Deprecated keys that have previously existed with warnings will be officially removed in the v1 schema, following the deprecation notices given in prior releases. This cleanup allows us to provide a cleaner and more consistent configuration format.

During the migration to v1:

- Automatic migration of certain deprecated keys (e.g., `setVariable` to `setVariables`) will be performed at package creation time.
- Deprecated keys that cannot be safely auto-migrated (e.g., `group` to `flavor`) will require manual migration instructions in documentation.
- The Zarf binary used in airgap or delivery environments will expect configuration files to conform to the v1 schema, removing support for deprecated keys at runtime.
- Users will receive clear errors or warnings if they attempt to use removed keys with v1.

This schema versioning approach ensures predictable backward compatibility within v1 while enabling removal of legacy features and better maintainability going forward. Future major versions (v2+) will then be free to introduce breaking changes with minimal risk of surprise.","## Decision

Zarf will begin having proper schema versions. A top level key, `apiVersion`, will be introduced to allow users to specify the schema. At the release of v1 the only valid user input for `apiVersion` will be v1. Zarf will not allow users to build using the v0 schema. `zarf package create` will fail if the user has deprecated keys or if `apiVersion` is missing and the user will be instructed to run the new `zarf dev migrate-schema` command. `zarf dev migrate-schema` will automatically migrate deprecated fields in the users `zarf.yaml` where possible. It will also add the apiVersion key and set it to v1.

The existing go types which comprise the Zarf schema will be moved to types/alpha and will never change. An updated copy of these types without the deprecated fields will be created in a package types/v1 and any future schema changes will affect these objects. Internally, Zarf will introduce translation functions which will take the alpha schema and return the v1 schema. From that point on, all function signatures that have a struct that is included in the Zarf schema will change from `types.structName` to `v1.structName`.

All deprecated features will cause an error on create. Deprecated features with a direct migration path will still be deployed if the package was created with schema v1, as migrations will add the non deprecated fields. If a feature does not have a direct automatic migration path (cosignKeyPath & groups) the package will fail on deploy. This will happen until the alpha schema is entirely removed from Zarf, which will happen one year after v1 is released.

At create time Zarf will package both a `zarf.yaml` and a `zarfv1.yaml`. If a `zarfv1.yaml` exists Zarf will use that. If a `zarfv1.yaml` does not exist, then Zarf will know that the package was created prior to v1 and use the regular `zarf.yaml`. If the package is deployed with v0 it will read the `zarf.yaml` as normal even if the package has a `zarfv1.yaml`. This will make it simpler to drop deprecated items with migration paths from the v1 schema while remaining backwards compatible as those deprecated items will exist in the `zarf.yaml`

When Zarf introduces new keys that they are not ready to promise long term support for they will mark them as experimental in the schema. A key is assumed to be stable if it's not experimental or deprecated.

There are several other keys Zarf will deprecate which will have automated migrations to new fields
- `.metadata.aggregateChecksum` -> `.build.aggregateChecksum`
- `.components[x].required` -> `.components[x].optional`. Optional will default to false. This is a change in behavior as currently `required` defaults to true. However, automatic migration will work since we can set optional to true on any components which do not already have required.
- Metadata fields `image`, `source`, `documentation`, `url`, `authors`, `vendors` -> will become a map of `annotations`
- `noWait` -> `wait` which will default to true. This change will happen on both `.components.[x].manifests` and `components.[x].charts`
- `yolo` -> `airgap` which will default to true
- `.components.[x].actions.[default/onAny].maxRetries` -> `.components.[x].actions.[default/onAny].retries`
- `.components.[x].actions.[default/onAny].maxTotalSeconds` -> `.components.[x].actions.[default/onAny].timeout`, which must be in a [Go recognized duration string format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
- charts will change to avoid [current confusion with keys](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/2245). Exactly one of the following fields will exist for each `components.[x].charts`.
