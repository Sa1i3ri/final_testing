* Currently, the images/thumbnails inside the Storefront are not making use of any lazy loading mechanism. 
* Without a third-party extension which includes something like ""lazysizes"" it is not possible to get lazy loading images.
* Native lazy loading of images is available in current browsers, see: https://caniuse.com/?search=loading","## Decision 
## Decision

* Use the native `loading=""lazy""` attribute for images in the Storefront to enable lazy loading without relying on third-party libraries.
* Apply `loading=""lazy""` to all offscreen or below-the-fold image elements (e.g., product thumbnails in listings, category pages, and pagination-based content).
* Ensure that critical above-the-fold images (e.g., hero banners, main product images) use `loading=""eager""` to prevent any render delay.
* This approach leverages built-in browser functionality, improves performance, reduces initial page load time and data usage, and maintains compatibility with existing markup.","## Decision

* We want to make use of native lazy loading for images in the Storefront without adding additional JavaScript logic."

When using the `OneToOneAssociationField` & `ManyToOneAssociationField` associations it is possible to specify the parameter `autoload` as `true`. This causes the association to be loaded with every query, regardless of whether the data is used or not.

This is a performance issue due to unnecessary data transfer, it slows down SQL queries with extra joins, slows the application down with hydrating and data processing and finally, API payloads are larger than they need to be.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will deprecate the `autoload` parameter in `OneToOneAssociationField` and `ManyToOneAssociationField`. Loading associations should never be enforced at the definition level, but instead be controlled explicitly by the query criteria using `addAssociation()`.

This change ensures that:
- Performance is improved by eliminating unnecessary joins and data hydration.
- Developers have full control over which associations are loaded, leading to more predictable and optimized queries.
- API responses contain only the requested data, reducing payload size.

Migration path:
1. Remove usage of `autoload => true` in field definitions.
2. Explicitly add required associations via criteria in services, repositories, or API controllers.
3. Update documentation and provide examples for proper association loading.

The feature will be removed in the next major version.","## Decision

We will deprecate the usage of autoload === true in the core codebase in version 6.5. All usages in entity definitions should be removed by the time 6.6 is released.

We have introduced a new PHPStan rule which will check for any usages of autoload === true and fail if it finds any. The failures are currently ignored in the `phpstan.neon.dist` file until they can be fixed by the respective teams."

Currently, our ADRs are grouped into folders according to different areas. We have added this structure to help people find their way around when they are looking for specific ADRs.

However, there are different approaches when searching for ADRs:
1) I am looking for an ADR and I know the headline.
2) I would like to read the latest ADRs
3) I would like to see ADRs for a specific area.
4) ...

The structuring by areas is good for case 3, but not for the other two. In the first case, the user can easily use the search via the directory to use the appropriate ADR, but will also get duplicate matches. Depending on the keyword the result can be quite long.

In the second case, I would like to read the latest ADRs, the user would have to go to git history, which is only possible via shell or IDE.","## Decision  
## Decision

We will maintain the current folder structure by area for domain organization and navigational clarity, as it supports focused exploration of ADRs within specific domains.

In parallel, we will introduce a **centralized `README.md`** in the ADR root directory that serves as a dynamic index. This README will be automatically updated and include:

- A **chronological list of all ADRs** (most recent first), showing:  
  - Date (from filename or `Date` field)  
  - Title  
  - Area (inferred from folder or metadata)  
  - Link to the ADR  

- A **searchable table of contents** grouped by area, with links to relevant ADRs.

This setup supports:
- **Case 1 (know the title)**: Use IDE/text search on the centralized README.
- **Case 2 (latest ADRs)**: Read the top entries in the chronological list.
- **Case 3 (specific area)**: Navigate via the grouped section in the README.
- **Future cases**: The README can evolve with filters, tags, or statuses.

Automation:  
A script (e.g. `adr-index`) will regenerate the README on each ADR creation or rename, ensuring consistency.

This decision preserves existing organizational benefits while significantly improving discoverability and access patterns across use cases.","## Decision

We will remove the area structure on directory level and introduce front matter in our ADRs as we already do in our changelog files. This makes it possible to extract metadata from content. Additionally, it can be used as groundwork, if we want to release our ADRs in different front-ends (handbook, dev-docs) and use the front-end's search functionalities.
With front matter and the flat file structure, you can solve all three problems described in this ADR. An example of this specific ADR would be:

```markdown
---
title: Unstructured ADRs
date: 2023-02-23
area: Product Operation #I added prod-ops because this is a workflow topic
tags: [ADR, file structure, workflow]
---
```

We also hope that this will make it easier for people to submit ADRs without being confused about which folder to put the file in."
"## Context
Our current plugin extension system for the administration is based on our Component Factory. This factory generates native Vue components at runtime based on a base Shopware component which can be extended or overwritten by plugins. This approach offers flexibility to plugin developers to modify every component. For the template part, we use Twig.JS and compile the Vue template in the client at runtime.

However, this approach has its drawbacks. We cannot use the full power of Vue and its ecosystem because everything related to Vue is wrapped with our factories and generated at runtime. We cannot use Vue tools without custom modifications, like linting template files, providing good static analysis, and more. The other downside is that upgrading Vue is challenging, and the performance suffers because we cannot precompile components.

To address these issues, we aimed to test a new idea with Vue 3, which includes all the features of the existing plugin approach, but developed using only native Vue tools. This would offer several benefits, like using the full power of Vue, better performance, better static analysis, and more.

Our main idea for the template part was to use native Vue components named sw-block that can replace the Twig.JS template part. Plugin developers can extend or overwrite the sw-block component as needed.

```html
<sw-block name=""sw-hello-world"">
<div>Hello World</div>
</sw-block>
```

For the script and logic part, we aimed to use the Composition API. Before returning all the component data and methods, we would provide a hook point for plugins so they could modify or inject everything they want.

```js
// The original component
<script setup lang=""ts"">
// Hook for providing extensibility
useExtensibility();
</script>

// The plugin component
<script lang=""ts"">
    import SwOrignal from './sw-original.vue';
    // use our extensibility helpers
    import { useComponentExtender, getPropsFromComponent } from 'sw-vue-extensbiles';
    
    const myCustomData = ref('test');
    
    export default {
        name: 'sw-extended-component',
        props: {
            ...getPropsFromComponent(SwOrignal)
        },
        setup(props, context) {
            return {
                ...useComponentExtender(SwOrignal, props, context),
                myCustomData
            }   
        }
}
</script>
```

However, during the evaluation and testing, we realized that this approach was not feasible due to several reasons. The most critical challenges were that it was hard to merge data because the Vue compiler optimizes many parts of the component, and it was not easy to pass all the data of the component to the block system to give plugin developers full access to the original component's data.

To solve these problems, we would need to use internal Vue logic, which is not update-safe and could break with every Vue update.","## Decision  
## Decision

We will not pursue the proposed native Vue-based extension system using `sw-block` and Composition API hooks for the administration in the near term. While the goal of leveraging native Vue features—such as improved performance, better tooling support, and compile-time templates—is valid and desirable, the current technical constraints make this approach infeasible.

The primary challenges identified during prototyping were:

- **Inability to safely merge component state**: Due to Vue’s compilation and reactivity optimizations (especially in `<script setup>`), accessing and merging internal component data, methods, and computed properties from plugins is unreliable without resorting to internal Vue APIs.
- **Fragility of extension mechanisms**: Any solution relying on introspecting or unwrapping compiled composition functions would tightly couple plugin logic to Vue’s internal behavior, making it vulnerable to breaking changes in future Vue updates.
- **Limited access to original component context**: Providing plugin developers full extensibility (e.g., overriding logic, extending templates) requires exposing a stable, well-documented extension interface that does not exist natively in Vue 3 for this use case.

Using internal Vue mechanics to work around these limitations would compromise long-term maintainability and upgradeability—defeating one of the core motivations behind the initiative.

Instead, we will continue with the current Component Factory system for the foreseeable future and focus on incremental improvements such as:
- Better TypeScript integration and documentation for existing extension patterns.
- Improved static analysis and linting within the constraints of runtime component generation.
- Exploring safer, higher-level extension APIs (e.g., dependency injection, composables, configuration objects) that align with Vue best practices and avoid direct component mutation.

A full migration to a native Vue-based extension model may be revisited in the future when either:
1. Vue provides official APIs for component introspection and safe extension, or
2. We can define a constrained, composable architecture that achieves extensibility without requiring deep component merging.

For now, stability, upgrade safety, and ecosystem compatibility take precedence over architectural idealism.","## Decision
After considering the challenges we faced with the proposed solution, we concluded that we couldn't find solutions without using internal Vue logic. Given this situation, we did not see any significant benefits to adopting a native Vue solution over our current plugin system, which, despite its challenges, has proven to work well for our use case.

Therefore, we decided to stick with our current plugin system for the administration until new possibilities arise in Vue that solve our problems."

The current workflow for writing technical changelog is not very suited for a trunk based development and branching process. There are some major issues with the current workflow of using one file with a fixed version number:

*  Unnecessary merge conflicts in the changelog file
*  Uncertainty about the correct release version of the change
*  Differences between the issue state in Jira and the code state

To tackle these issues the technique for writing technical changelog and upgrade information, should be changed to a single solution, which is easy to understand and maintain by developers.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will adopt a **per-commit changelog entry** approach using structured changelog fragments, inspired by practices in projects like [Fedora](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-developer-guide/changelogs/) and [Towncrier](https://towncrier.readthedocs.io/).

### Chosen Solution:
Each pull request or commit that introduces a user-visible change must include a **changelog fragment file** in a dedicated `changelog/` directory (or similar), named following a convention such as `PR-1234.feature`, `ISSUE-5678.bugfix`, etc.

These fragment files contain a short, plain-text description of the change, written in the present tense, from the user’s perspective. During release preparation, these fragments are automatically aggregated into the final `CHANGELOG.md` for the new version and then removed or archived.

### File types (categories):
- `.feature` – New functionality
- `.bugfix` – Bug fixes
- `.breaking` – Breaking changes (requires special attention)
- `.deprecated` – Features marked for removal
- `.removal` – Removed features
- `.internal` – Internal changes (optional, may not appear in public changelog)

### Rationale:
- ✅ **Eliminates merge conflicts**: Each change has its own file.
- ✅ **Decouples from version number**: Version is assigned at release time; fragments are collected then.
- ✅ **Clear audit trail**: Each changelog entry is tied to a PR/commit.
- ✅ **Automatable**: Scripts can collect, sort, format, and remove fragments during release.
- ✅ **Supports trunk-based development**: Works seamlessly with continuous integration and long-lived main branches.
- ✅ **Improves accuracy**: Reduces risk of forgetting or misclassifying changes.

### Workflow Integration:
- A CI check ensures that any PR with user-facing changes includes a changelog fragment (unless explicitly waived with a label like `skip-changelog`).
- Templates or scripts help developers create fragments easily.
- Release tooling generates the consolidated changelog on tag creation.

This approach aligns with modern DevOps practices and scales well for large teams and frequent releases.","## Decision
The changelog and upgrade files for a release should be autogenerated in the build process of the release. Developers should write technical changelog and upgrade information in separate markdown files."
"## Context

The actions in Flow Builder are listening for Business Events. We want to implement the flow DelayAction in Flow Builder,
that means the actions can be delayed, and will be executed after  a set amount of time.
But we have some problems after the action was delayed:
* Events may contain old data, that data may be updated during the delay, and currently we don't have any way to restore
    the data.
* After a delay the rules have to be re-evaluated, but the data in the rules could be outdated or changed, so the rules
    have to be reloaded as well. Or the rules do not exist anymore.","## Decision 
## Decision

To support delayed execution in the Flow Builder's `DelayAction`, we will adopt an **event-sourcing and rule re-evaluation** approach at the time of execution, rather than relying on stale event data.

When a flow triggers a `DelayAction`:
- The system persists the **intent** to execute the action later, including the flow context, reference to the original business event, and the delay duration.
- Instead of storing potentially stale entity data, only stable identifiers (e.g. entity IDs, event type, version/timestamp) are retained.
- Upon delay completion, the system:
  1. **Re-hydrates the current state** by loading the latest versions of relevant entities via their repositories.
  2. **Re-evaluates all associated rules** within an up-to-date `RuleScope` using current `Context` and `SalesChannelContext`.
  3. **Validates rule definitions** still exist and are active; if not, the action is skipped and a warning is logged.
  4. Proceeds with action execution only if all rules pass with current data.

This ensures that delayed actions operate on accurate, consistent state and prevents side effects based on outdated information. Data integrity is preserved through re-evaluation rather than snapshotting.","## Decision

We would need to detach the Event System and the Flow System from each other, thus removing the dependency on the runtime objects within an event.
Meaning the Actions must not have access to the original Events.

We would create a class `StorableFlow`, that can store the data in the original event as scalar values, and restore the original data based on this stored data.
```php
class StorableFlow
{
    // contains the scalar values based on the original events
    // $store can be serialized and used to restore the object data
    protected array $store = [];
    
    // contains the restored object data like the data we defined in the `availableData` in original events 
    // $data can not be serialized, but can be restored from $store
    protected array $data = [];
      
    public function __construct(array $store = [], array $data = [])
    {
        $this->store = $store;
        $this->data = $data;
    }
    
    // This method will be called in each `Storer` to store the representation of data
    public function setStore(string $key, $value) {
        $this->store[$key] = $value;
    }
    
    public function getStore(string $key) {
        return $this->store[$key];
    }
    
    // After we restored the data in `Storer`, we can set the data, we'll use `$this->data` instead getter data on original event
    public function setData(string $key, $value) {
        $this->data[$key] = $value;
    }
    
    public function getData(string $key) {
        return $this->data[$key];
    }
}
```

The `StorableFlow` class will be use on Flow Builder:

Before:

```php
class FlowDispatcher 
{
    public function dispatch(Event $event) {
        ...
        // Currently, dispatch on Flow Builder use the original event to execute the Flow 
        $this->callFlowExecutor($event);
        ...
    }
}
```

After:

```php
class FlowDispatcher 
{
    public function dispatch(Event $event) {
        ...
        // The `FlowFactory` will create/restore the `StorableFlow` from original event
        $flow = $this->flowFactory->create($event);
        // use the `StorableFlow` to execute the flow builder actions instead of the original events
        $this->execute($flow);
        ...
    }
}
```

* Flow Builder actions may no longer access the original event.
* Each Aware Interface gets its own `Storer` class to restore the data of Aware, so we have many `Storer` like `OrderStorer`, `MailStorer`, `CustomerStorer` ...
* The main task of a `Storer` is to restore the data from a scalar storage.
* The `Storer` provides a store function, in order to store itself the data, in order restore the object
* The `Storer` provides a restore function to restore the object using the store data.

```php
interface FlowStorer {}
```
Example for `OrderStorer`:

```php
class OrderStorer implements FlowStorer
{
    // This function to check the original event is the instanceof Aware interface, and store the representation.
    public function store(FlowEventAware $event, array $storedData): array 
    {
        if ($event instanceof OrderAware) {
            $storedData['orderId'] = $event->getOrderId();
        }
        
        return $storedData;
    }
    
    // This function is restore the data based on representation in `storedData`
    public function restore(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {
        if ($flow->hasStore('orderId')) {
            // allows to provide a closure for lazy data loading
            // this opens the opportunity to have lazy loading for big data
            // When we load the entity, we need to add the necessary associations for each entity
            $flow->lazy('order', [$this, 'load']);    
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

About the additional data defined in `availableData` in original events, that aren't defined in any Aware Interfaces and we can't restore that data in the `Storer`.
To cover the additional data from original events, we will have another `store` `AdditionalStorer` to store those data.
```php
class AdditionalStorer extends FlowStorer
{
    public function store(FlowEventAware $event, array $storedData)
    {
        ...
        // based on the `getAvailableData` in the original event to get the type of additional data
        $additionalDataTypes = $event::getAvailableData()->toArray();
        
        foreach ($additionalDataTypes as $key => $eventData) {
            // Check if the type of data is Entity or EntityCollection
            // in the $storedData, we only store the presentation like ['id' => id, 'entity' => entity], we'll restore the data in `AdditionalStorer::restore`
            if ($eventData['type'] === 'Entity' || 'EntityCollection') {
                $storedData[$key] = [
                    'id' => $event->getId(),
                    'entity' => Entity                 
                ];
            }
            
            // Check if the type of data is ScalarValueType
            if ($eventData['type'] === ScalarValueType) {
                $storedData[$key] = value
            }
            
            // start to implement /Serializable for ObjectType
            if ($eventData['type'] === ObjectType) {
                $storedData[$key] = value->serialize()
            }
            
            ...
        }
        
        ... 
        
        return $storedData;
    }
      
    // this function  make sure we can restore the additional data from original data are not covered in `Storer`
    // The additional data can be other entity, because the entities we defined in Aware interface like `order`, `customer` ... covered be `Storer`
    public function restore(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {
        if (type === entity) {
            // About the associations for entity data, mostly the additional entity data is the base entity, we don't need to add associations for this
            $flow->setData($key, $this->load());
        } else {
            $flow->setData($key, $flow->getStore($key));
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

About the associations for entity data, mostly the additional entity data is the base entity, we don't need to add associations for this.
About the `ObjectType` data, we enforce all values used in ObjectType implement /Serializable, and serialize the object before store to `$storedData`.

* Flow Builder actions only work with the `StorableFlow` instead of the `FlowEvent`. The `StorableFlow` will restore the data from original events via `Storer`,
  and the Actions can get the data via `getData($key)` from `StorableFlow` instead of `getAvailableData` from original events.

Before, in the flow actions still dependency Aware interfaces:

```php
    public function handle(StorableFlow $event) {
        ...
        $baseEvent = $event->getEvent();
    
        if ($baseEvent instanceof CustomerAware) {
            $customerId= $baseEvent->getCustomerId();
        }
        ...
    }
```
After in the flow actions:
```php
    public function handle(StorableFlow $event) {
        ...
        if ($event->hasStore('customerId') {
            $customerId= $event->getStore('customerId');
        }
        ...
    }
```

* `getAvailableData` must NOT be responsible for the access of the data.
* To create new or restore the `StorableFlow` by on the existing stored data, we need to provider the `FlowFactory`.
```php
class FlowFactory
{    
    ...
    public function create(FlowEventAware $event)
    {
        $storedData = [];
        foreach ($this->storer as $storer) {
            // Storer are responsible to move the corresponding 
            // data from the original event 
            $storer->store($event, $storedData);
        }
        
        return $this->restore($storedData);
    }
  
    public function restore(array $stored = [], array $data = [])
    {
        $flow = new StorableFlow($stored, $data);
      
        foreach ($this->storer as $storer) {
            $storer->restore($flow);
        }
  
        return $flow;
    }
    ...
}
```
But when executing a delayed actions, we won't have a `StorableFlow`, we just have the `$stored` from the previously stored `StorableFlow`,
and based on the `$stored`, we can restore a new `StorableFlow`.

Example in Delay Actions:

```php
// In handler delay actions -> put the actions to `queue`
$stored = json_encode($flow->stored());

$connection->executeStatement('INSERT INTO `swag_delay_action` (store) VALUES (:stored)...', ['stored' => $stored]);
```

```php
// In handler execute delay actions
$stored = 'SELECT store FROM `swag_delay_action` .... ';

$flow = $this->flowFactory->restore(json_decode($stored));
```"

We need a different extension mechanism besides the well known plugins, that works in cloud and on-prem environments in the same way.
That's why we envisioned the app system, currently publicly available as a [plugin](https://github.com/shopware/app-system).
We were able to quickly develop the app system, gather feedback and iterate over ideas without being bound to the strict release workflow of the shopware platform.
That was the reason why we started working on the app system as a plugin in the first place.

Now as the app system matured, it is time to integrate the app system back into the platform.
This has the following benefits:
* It sends the signal to partners and potential app manufacturers that the app system is stable
* Partners / app manufacturers can rely on the shopware 6 release cycle and the according upgrade process
* Users don't need to install an extra plugin in order to use apps","## Decision  
## Decision

Integrate the app system directly into the Shopware platform repository (`shopware/platform`), removing its status as a separate plugin.

This integration includes:
- Merging the core functionality of the app system from the `shopware/app-system` plugin into `shopware/platform`
- Maintaining backward compatibility during the transition to ensure existing apps continue to work
- Ensuring the app system follows the standard Shopware 6 release and upgrade processes
- Deprecating and eventually sunsetting the standalone `shopware/app-system` plugin once integration is complete and stable

Rationale:
- Promotes the app system as a first-class, supported feature of Shopware
- Simplifies installation and maintenance for users
- Aligns development and release cycles with the core platform
- Strengthens trust and adoption among partners and developers

The app system will remain environment-agnostic and fully functional in both cloud and on-prem deployments.","## Decision

We will migrate the existing app system from the [plugin](https://github.com/shopware/app-system) into the platform. The app system will be part of the core bundle, analogous to the plugin system.
It will be moved to the `Shopware\Core\Framework\App` namespace."

At the moment we have a bunch of different `FlowStorer` implementations. Most of them are used to store scalar values without any restore logic. Each of the Storer class has an own interface which is used to identify if the data of the event should be stored. This leads to much boilerplate code when adding new storer implementations or when plugins want to bypass some for events.","## Decision 
## Decision

Introduce a unified, generic `FlowStorer` interface that abstracts over the storage of scalar event data, decoupling storer implementations from event types. This interface will define minimal contract methods such as `Store(event Event, value interface{})` and `ShouldStore(event Event) bool`, allowing for centralized registration and evaluation of storers.

Replace individual storer interfaces with metadata-based tagging or annotations (e.g., using struct tags or registry entries) to determine applicability to specific events. This enables plugins or core logic to dynamically include or exclude storers based on configuration or context without modifying event definitions.

Additionally, introduce a `FlowStorerRegistry` that manages the lifecycle and ordering of storers, reducing boilerplate and enabling composability. This simplifies extension points for plugins and ensures consistent behavior across storer implementations.","## Decision

We introduce a generic `ScalarValuesAware` interface which can be used to store simple values which should be simply stored and restored one to one:

```php
interface ScalarValuesAware
{
    public const STORE_VALUES = 'scalar_values';
    
    /** @return array<string, scalar|null|array> */
    public function getValues(): array;
}
```

This event can be used in different events which needs a simple storage logic:

```php
class SomeFlowAwareEvent extends Event implements ScalarStoreAware, FlowEventAware
{
    public function __construct(private readonly string $url) { }

    public function getValues(): array
    {
        return ['url' => $this->url];
    }
}
```

To store and restore this data, we provide a simple `FlowStorer` implementation:

```php

class ScalarValuesStorer extends FlowStorer
{
    public function store(FlowEventAware $event, array $stored): array
    {
        if (!$event instanceof ScalarValuesAware) return $stored

        $stored[ScalarValuesAware::STORE_VALUES] = $event->getValues();

        return $stored;
    }

The current sw-text-editor in the administration has numerous low-level bugs in basic WYSIWYG features. It is built in a
way that is difficult to maintain and understand. Therefore, we require a new text editor that is easy to maintain, has
a good feature set, is flexible to extend and more stable.","## Decision 
## Decision

Replace the current `sw-text-editor` with a modern, well-maintained WYSIWYG editor framework that offers robust core functionality, clear extensibility APIs, and strong community or commercial support. After evaluation, we will adopt **Tiptap** (a headless, extendable Vue-based editor built on ProseMirror) as the foundation for the new text editor in the administration.

This choice ensures maintainability through clean architecture, enables future feature extensions (e.g., collaborative editing, custom nodes), improves stability, and aligns with our Vue-based tech stack. Custom UI components will be built on top of Tiptap to match the administration’s design language.","## Decision
Building a new text editor from scratch is not a viable option. Therefore, we have evaluated various existing text 
editors and narrowed down our options to the following:

    - CKEditor 5
    - TinyMCE
    - QuillJS
    - Prosemirror
    - TipTap V2
    - Lexical

We have decided to skip CKEditor 5 and TinyMCE because they require a license for our use case and are not 100% open
source. Prosemirror was also ruled out because it provides only a low-level API and requires much more implementation 
time than the other editors. Additionally, Lexical is not a valid option for us since it is specialized for React 
environments and has no official support for VueJS.

The remaining two editors are TipTap V2 and QuillJS. Both have similar feature sets and APIs, but we have found some 
major differences between them. The first difference is that TipTap is a headless editor, which means that it only
provides the editor logic and requires a UI implementation. QuillJS, on the other hand, is a fully featured editor that
provides a UI out of the box. In our case, it is better to use a headless editor like TipTap because we can implement 
the UI to fit our needs, especially for several edge cases that are hard to implement in QuillJS.

The second major difference is in extensibility. TipTap's API is more flexible, allowing us to implement our own
features using the existing TipTap and ProseMirror plugins or build our own plugins. In most cases, the powerful main
TipTap API can already solve most of our use cases. QuillJS, on the other hand, is not as flexible as TipTap, and its
extension system is more complicated to use.

The third big difference is in stability. We found that TipTap is more stable than QuillJS, probably because TipTap is 
built on top of ProseMirror, which is a very stable and well-tested editor. Although QuillJS is also generally stable,
other developers have reported some issues with it in the past.

Our main decision driver was the extensibility of the editor. We want a text editor that is easy to extend and allows us
to implement our own features. TipTap provides a powerful extension system that is easy to use, and we can implement our
design without overwriting an existing design of other editors. Therefore, we have decided to use TipTap as the base of
our new text editor."

The current implementation of the salutation in Shopware 6 needs to handle cases where the salutation is not specified by the customer or administrator. To address this requirement and promote inclusivity, we have updated the default salutation to ""not_specified"" for unspecified salutations in our Shopware 6 platform.","## Decision 
## Decision

The default salutation value in Shopware 6 is set to `not_specified` to explicitly represent cases where the customer or administrator has not provided a salutation. This change improves data clarity and supports inclusivity by avoiding assumptions about gender or title. The `not_specified` value must be handled consistently across all contexts—including storefront, admin, emails, and exports—and must not be rendered as visible text in customer-facing interfaces without appropriate localization or fallback behavior.","## Decision
We have modified the existing salutation handling in Shopware 6 to update the default value to ""not_specified"" when the salutation is null. This decision was made based on the following considerations:

* Inclusivity: By offering a default salutation of ""not_specified"" for null values, we promote inclusivity and ensure that all customers are appropriately addressed, even when salutation data is missing.
* Customer Experience: Providing a default salutation ensures consistency in customer communications and prevents any confusion or misinterpretation when a salutation is not explicitly specified.
* Non-Deletable Default Salutation: It has been decided that the ""not_specified"" salutation, being the default value for unspecified salutations, should not be deletable by the shop owner. This ensures that there is always a fallback option available, guaranteeing a consistent experience for customers."

The storefront CSS, compiled by `scssphp/scssphp`, is currently automatically prefixed with vendor prefixes using `padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer`.
However, the generated prefixes no longer add much value since the browser support has been updated with the Bootstrap v5 update.
Most of the prefixes are unnecessary for the supported browsers in .browserslist.
Unfortunately, the `theme:compile` process experiences a significant decrease in performance due to the auto-prefixer, which is particularly problematic in our SaaS solution.
Moreover, the `padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer` package does not work dynamically and fails to consider `.browserslist` while applying the appropriate vendor-prefixes.
This package hard-codes the CSS properties that require prefixing, making it an unsustainable long-term solution.
To demonstrate this, a table containing all automatic prefixes generated by `padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer` is provided below.","## Decision 
## Decision

Remove `padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer` from the SCSS compilation process in the Storefront.

Justification:

* The `.browserslist` configuration now targets modern browsers where most CSS features do not require vendor prefixes.
* The current auto-prefixer does not respect `.browserslist` and applies prefixes unconditionally based on a hard-coded list, leading to unnecessary and outdated prefixes.
* The performance overhead during `theme:compile` is significant, especially in CI/CD and SaaS environments where compilation speed impacts deployment times.
* Modern frontend tooling (e.g., Tailwind, Vite, Webpack) typically handle prefixing via `autoprefixer` with `browserslist`, which is more accurate and efficient. Aligning with this standard approach improves maintainability.
* Removing the PHP-based auto-prefixer reduces technical debt and external dependencies on unmaintained or poorly maintained packages.

Fallback / Alternative:

* If required, vendors needing custom prefixing can integrate `autoprefixer` into their own build pipeline using Node.js-based tooling, which supports dynamic prefixing based on `.browserslist`.

Outcome:

* Faster theme compilation.
* Cleaner, more standards-compliant CSS output.
* Reduced dependency on outdated tooling.","## Decision

* Due to the above points we have decided to disable the CSS auto-prefixing by default.
* In case it is still needed, to support older browsers or some special CSS property from the table above, it can still be activated via the config key `storefront.theme.auto_prefix_css` in `Storefront/Resources/config/packages/storefront.yaml`. However, we recommend to do a manual prefix inside the SCSS instead.
* We will deprecate the auto-prefixing for v6.6.0 and only use SCSS compiling
* We do not consider the deactivation of the auto-prefixing as a hard breaking change because:
    * Most prefixes are not needed due to current browser support.
    * Some prefixes are for CSS properties which are no longer implemented and developed by browsers.
    * Prefixes which are still valid are primarily cosmetic/appearance properties which are very unlikely to affect the Storefronts functionality."

A pre-release package version is a version followed by a hyphen and an alphanumeric string.

Imagine the following scenario:
* An imaginary package is marked as insecure with version 1.8.7
* The issue is fixed with 2.0.0
* We use version `1.9.0-alpha1`
* Any pre-release package version like `1.9.0-alpha1` is interpreted as `<0.0.0` by npm

Why is this problematic?

The insecurity introduced with version `1.8.7` would never get reported to us by npm, unless we switch to a none pre-release version.","## Decision 
## Decision

Avoid using pre-release versions (e.g., `1.9.0-alpha1`) when publishing security-sensitive or production-critical packages.

Instead, use full release versions (e.g., `1.9.0`) even for early updates, to ensure that version comparison tools like npm's audit system correctly interpret version precedence and can properly flag insecure dependencies.

Pre-release tags compromise the reliability of automated vulnerability detection, as they are treated as lower than all stable releases — including older, insecure ones. This creates a blind spot in dependency auditing.

If staging or testing is required, leverage dist-tags (e.g., `npm dist-tag add mypkg@1.9.0 beta`) to control visibility and installation channels without sacrificing semantic versioning integrity.","## Decision
Using pre-release package versions is prohibited.
This will be checked via a npm `preinstall` script."

The existing SQL snippet to delete the outdated cart entries doesn't use any database index to narrow down entries that can be deleted. 
On high traffic shops this leads to SQL query times larger than 30 seconds to find and remove these database entries.

Running 
```
EXPLAIN DELETE FROM cart
WHERE (updated_at IS NULL AND created_at <= '2023-02-01')
   OR (updated_at IS NOT NULL AND updated_at <= '2023-02-01') LIMIT 1000;
```
shows that the original sql query doesn't use an index (`possible_keys` = `NULL`)","## Decision 
## Decision

We will optimize the `DELETE` query for outdated cart entries by ensuring it uses an appropriate database index. To achieve this:

1. **Create a Composite Index**: Add a composite index on the `cart` table covering both `created_at` and `updated_at` columns to allow efficient filtering in the WHERE clause.

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_cart_cleanup ON cart (created_at, updated_at);
   ```

2. **Optimize Query Structure**: Rewrite the DELETE condition to improve index utilization and avoid OR conditions that can hinder index usage. We split the logic into two separate indexed queries using a UNION or handle them sequentially within a transaction.

   Example optimized execution:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM cart 
   WHERE created_at <= '2023-02-01' 
     AND (updated_at IS NULL OR updated_at <= '2023-02-01')
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

   This form allows the database to efficiently use the composite index.

3. **Batch Deletion**: Continue using `LIMIT 1000` (or configurable batch size) to prevent long-running transactions and reduce lock contention.

4. **Add Index in Migration**: Include the index creation in a migration script to ensure all installations benefit from the optimization.

5. **Monitor & Validate**: After deployment, monitor query performance via `EXPLAIN` to confirm index usage and reduced execution time.

These changes will significantly reduce query execution time, especially in high-traffic environments, by leveraging proper indexing and optimized query planning.","## Decision

Reorder the query parameters so that the relevant cart entries can be narrowed down by an indexed field.

Testing the new SQL snippet by running 
```
EXPLAIN DELETE FROM cart
        WHERE created_at <= '2023-02-01'
          AND (updated_at IS NULL OR updated_at <= '2023-02-01') LIMIT 1000;

shows that the new query uses an index (`possible_keys` = `idx.cart.created_at`)."
"## Context

Currently, it is hard to publish features in an early state to gather feedback regarding those features. If they are useful, what needs to be improved etc.
One major reason is that everything we publish (that is not marked as internal) is part of our backwards compatibility promise, thus changing foundational parts of features is quite hard after first release.
That leads to features being developed over quite some time without getting actual feedback from users or being able to release them, as they need to be implemented to a pretty final state in order to confidently release them in a stable manner, where we will keep backwards compatibility.

This at the same time also means that the current approach is not beneficial to our ecosystem, whom the whole backwards compatibility promise should benefit, because the features are built behind closed curtains they can't chime in with ideas and use cases regarding extendability, etc.

Examples of features that could benefit from an earlier experimental release:
* B2B:
  * We could release the multi account B2B feature with a ""simple"" employee management system first, and then add the more complex budget management or access control on top of that later.
* Advanced Search:
  * We could release a first version of the new advanced search feature, without all configuration options and customizability that we might envision.

In both cases, releasing the first increments of the features without an ""experimental""-flag would mean that we would have to keep backwards compatibility for the whole feature, even if we later decide to change the implementation of the feature, thus making the development of the feature harder.
Also in getting feedback from the customers what additional functionalities are needed after we released the first foundational increment of the feature, we can base our further prioritization on real customer feedback.
Thus, we can ship business value sooner to our customers and lower the risk of building the wrong thing.","## Decision 
## Decision

Introduce an **experimental features framework** that allows us to release early versions of features under a clear ""experimental"" designation, exempt from the backward compatibility promise.

This framework includes:

- A formal **experimental flag** (e.g., feature toggle, header, or API version) to enable experimental functionality.
- Clear **documentation and UI indicators** signaling that a feature is experimental, including potential instability, breaking changes, or removal without notice.
- An **opt-in requirement** for users who wish to use experimental features.
- A defined **lifecycle process** for experimental features: incubation → feedback → stabilization → graduation (or deprecation).
- Explicit **exclusion from SLAs and support guarantees** unless otherwise stated.

By adopting this approach, we enable faster iteration, earlier user feedback, and data-driven prioritization—while protecting the stability and compatibility expectations of our core platform. Features like B2B multi-account management and Advanced Search will be among the first candidates for this model.","## Decision

To ship features earlier, we add the concept of ""experimental"" features, thus giving early access to meaningful increments of features that are still in active development.
That means in particular that there is no backwards compatibility promise for experimental features, thus we can change the implementation as is needed, without having to worry about breaking changes.
We mark the code for those features with a new `experimental` annotation, to make it clear on code level that the API is **not yet** stable.
For code where already expect that it should never become part of the public API we will use the `@internal` annotation directly, to make sure that even if the feature is stable we will continue to tread those parts of the code as internal and not keep backwards compatible.
Everything that is marked with `@experimental` is designed to be part of the public API, when the feature is stable.

At the same time, it offers a way for the ecosystem to give early feedback on the feature, as well as to test it in their own projects. Especially, extension developers can check how they might want to integrate and extend the feature being built, and thus suggest the needed extension points during the development process.
To make this possible that means that there also will be documentation (API docs, dev docs and user docs) for experimental features

All experimental features are developed with a specific target version, beginning with that version, the feature is considered stable, and the APIs will be kept backwards compatible.
This means that `experimental` annotation/attribute have to be removed, before the version can be released. Because it is hard to estimate exactly with which release a feature may be stable (as it also depends on the feedback we get) it makes sense to mark them as being stable with the next major version.
That does not mean that the feature won't be finished and stable earlier (we can remove the experimental status with any minor version), it only means that at the latest with that version it is considered stable, this prevents a situation where a lot of features stay in the experimental state for a long time."

The stock handling in Shopware 6 is currently not very flexible and does not support many common use cases. 

* It's not possible to easily replace the loading of stocks with a custom implementation, for example one that communicates with an ERP.
* It's not possible to easily modify how stock is increased/decreased throughout the order lifecycle.
* Available stock calculation is very slow on large catalogs.
* Stock is stored as two distinct values: stock and available stock. This is due to the fact that stock is not reduced until an order is set as completed. Therefore, the available stock is calculated as the stock minus all open orders. This is unnecessarily complex.","## Decision 
## Decision

* Introduce a new `StockProviderInterface` that is responsible for loading the current stock of a product.
* The default implementation will read the stock from the database, but plugins can replace this with custom logic (e.g. ERP integration).
* Deprecate the concept of ""available stock"" and instead always work with a single ""stock"" value.
* Stock will be reduced immediately when an order is placed (at latest when state changes to ""in progress""), not deferred until order completion.
* Introduce configurable stock behavior per sales channel:
  * Option to reserve stock on cart creation or only on order placement
  * Option to define how long reservations last before being released
* Optimize stock queries by introducing caching and batch loading where appropriate.
* Provide clear extension points for plugins to hook into stock changes (events or decorators).","## Decision

We have only one field `stock` in the product definition which always has a real time calculated value.

The `stock` value should be correctly updated as an order and its line items transition through the various states. Eg, stock is decremented when an order is placed. If it is cancelled, the stock is increased, and so on.

We have a clear API for manipulating stock which can be extended and supports arbitrary data, which could, for example, support features such as multi warehouse inventory.

We have a way to disable the stock handling behavior of Shopware."

By default, every exception that is thrown in the PHP stack and not caught will be logged by the `symfony/monolog-bridge` on `error` level.
But there are some cases where the exception is caused by clients accessing the API wrong (missing fields etc.) and throwing an `ShopwareHttpException` with an HTTP-Status-Code of 40x is our way of handling such situations and returning a correct HTTP-Status-Code to the client.
So those cases are in fact no ""errors"" that need to be analyzed, but are expected given a malformed API request.
Logging those cases as ""errors"" produces a lot of noise, which makes it harder to actually find errors in the logs.

For our cloud product, we already used a configuration list that configures that some Exception classes should only be logged as notices.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will introduce a logging configuration that downgrades specific client-related exceptions—such as `ShopwareHttpException` with 4xx HTTP status codes—from `error` level to `notice` or `info` level in the logs.

This reduces log noise by distinguishing between actual application errors (5xx, unexpected failures) and expected client input errors (4xx, invalid requests), improving signal-to-noise ratio in monitoring and alerting systems.

The configuration will be implemented via Monolog processor or handler that inspects the exception type and HTTP status code before determining the log level. A centralized list of such exception classes and conditions will be maintained for consistency across services.

This approach aligns with cloud practices already in use and ensures production maintainability.","## Decision

We add a configuration to the platform that degrades the error level of specific exceptions to notices. This way, external hosters can also profit from our classification.
We use [symfony's `exceptions` configuration](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/framework.html#exceptions) for this.

This has the benefit that for specific projects this configuration could be adjusted, for example, for cases where you also control all clients that access the shop, you may want to log also every client error, just to help debugging the client.

Another solution could be to do the configuration of the log level directly in the exception class either by attributes or a separate method specifying the log level, but that would make overwriting it for a specific project harder, so we stick to the default symfony configuration."

Using UUIDs as primary keys eases the integration of several different data sources,
but it also brings some performance issues.

Currently, we're using UUIDv4, which is a random UUID the completely random prefix means
that the B-tree indexes of the database are not very efficient.

UUIDv7 time-based prefix is less spread than that of UUIDv4, this helps the database to keep the index more compact.
It allows the Index to allocate fewer new pages and to keep the index smaller.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will migrate from UUIDv4 to UUIDv7 for primary keys in all new database schemas where distributed generation and temporal locality are beneficial. 

UUIDv7 provides a time-ordered prefix which improves B-tree index performance by reducing page splits, enhancing cache locality, and enabling more efficient range queries. This results in better write throughput, smaller index sizes, and faster reads compared to fully random UUIDv4.

For existing systems using UUIDv4, we will maintain backward compatibility but encourage migration in major version updates where feasible. New modules and services must use UUIDv7 unless there is a compelling reason to use an alternative identifier scheme.

This change aligns with modern best practices for distributed systems requiring both global uniqueness and storage efficiency.","## Decision

Considering there is little risk to using UUIDv7, as v4 and v7 share the same
length and are indistinguishable for shopware, we can switch to v7 without any risk
of breaking anything.

The effort is also very low as we only need to change the
implementation of the `Uuid` class. As using UUIDv7 will improve the speed of
bulk product inserts by about 8 %, we think the effort is worth the measurable and
theoretical gain."

## Decision

The list of available events in the flow builder must be extendable by apps. 

To achieve this, a new extensibility point will be introduced that allows apps to register custom events. These events will then be dynamically loaded and displayed in the flow builder's event selection interface. Each registered event must provide:
- A unique identifier
- A human-readable label
- Required and optional payload structure definition
- Trigger conditions or metadata

Right now only Shopware Backend is able to communicate with the App Server in a secure way.
This is because the App Server is able to verify the origin of the request by checking request signature, 
and this signature is generated by the Shopware 6 backend application with a shop to app server secret.

When an app wants to communicate directly with the App Server,
the App Server is not able to verify the origin of the request and has to trust the client.
This works fine for public available data, but not when you reliably need the logged-in customer and other information.","## Decision 
## Decision

To enable secure communication from client-side apps (e.g. storefront, PWA) to the App Server while preserving customer context and preventing spoofing, a signed JWT-based token mechanism will be introduced.

The Shopware backend will issue short-lived, cryptographically signed tokens containing verified customer and sales channel context upon successful authentication. These tokens can be obtained by the client (e.g. via authenticated API routes) and sent to the App Server as a bearer token.

The App Server will validate the token signature using the existing shop-to-app secret and extract the trusted context (e.g. customer ID, sales channel ID). This allows the App Server to securely act on behalf of the authenticated customer without relying on untrusted client claims.

This approach ensures:
- The App Server can verify the authenticity of the request origin
- Customer context is preserved and trustworthy
- No need to expose sensitive secrets to the client
- Consistent security model across backend-to-app and client-to-app communication","## Decision

We provide a new endpoint `/store-api/app-system/{appName}/generate-token` (`/app-system/{appName}/generate-token` in Storefront) which generates a JWT token for the given app.
This endpoint requires that the customer is logged-in and the app is installed and active. 

The JWT token contains claims like:
- `iat` - issued at
- `exp` - expiration time
- `shopId` - the shop id of the current shop
- `salesChannelId` - the sales channel id of the current sales channel
- `customerId` - the customer id of the logged-in customer
- `cartToken` - the cart token of the current cart

The additional claims are bound to app permissions when an app does not have permissions to read a customer,
it does not get the `customerId` claim.

The JWT token is signed with the shop to app server secret key which we use already for the signature.
So the App Server needs to be able to verify the JWT key and use the claims in a secure way.
The request body of the client is still untrusted and has to be properly validated by the app server.

The request cycle would look like this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Shopware Backend
    participant App Server
    Client->>Shopware Backend: GET /store-api/app-system/TestApp/generate-token
    Shopware Backend->>Client: Responds with Signed JWT Token
    Client->>App Server: Post /product-review/submit containing JWT in header
```

The JWT token is valid for 15 minutes and can be used multiple times until expired.
The client should save it in the [session storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)
and request it only on expiry again.
Additionally, the API route should be rate limited to not generate too often an expensive JWT key."

In the past merchants had to deal with issues where their custom-built flow did not
behave how they intended it to do. An concrete example: We've had a merchant that contacted
us (shopware) that their shop did not sent out mails. Debugging the flow turned out to
be harder than we thought and honestly harder than it should be. The flow builder should
empower users to build reliable flows and not spend their precious time trying to
figure out what went wrong.

To improve the experience when using the Flow Builder were taking measures. First,
Flow Builder Preview and second Flow Builder Logging. This ADR only discusses the former one,
there are plans internally for the latter one, but it won't get much attention for now, as
it also addresses different issues (what does my flow do vs what went wrong in the past).

Users should be able to preview a flow and get further understanding on how a flow executes.
This preview only displays the steps and decisions happening inside a flow but doesn't
execute / simulate the real flow","## Decision 
## Decision

We will implement a **Flow Builder Preview** feature that provides a visual and interactive representation of the flow structure, showing all steps, conditions, and branching logic without executing any actions. This preview will be accessible directly within the Flow Builder interface and will serve as a static analysis tool to help merchants understand the control flow and data path of their configured workflows.

The preview will clearly visualize:
- Sequence of actions and triggers
- Conditional branches (yes/no paths)
- Entry and exit points
- Connected entities and expected payloads

By decoupling visualization from execution, we ensure safety (no unintended side effects) while significantly improving debuggability and user confidence. This approach aligns with the principle of least surprise and supports our goal of making complex automation accessible to non-technical users.

This decision prioritizes immediate usability and clarity over full behavioral simulation, which may be addressed in future iterations through complementary logging and replay capabilities.","## Decision

In the current media system it is possible to configure different `Shopware\Core\Content\Media\Pathname\PathnameStrategy\PathnameStrategyInterface`.

These strategies are used to store files, which are uploaded for media entity, under a certain path.

The configured strategy is then also used to generate the URL that is used in the frontend/store API to embed the file.

The generation of this URL is currently triggered in an event subscriber which is registered to the `media.loaded` event.

For generating the URL an implementation of the `UrlGeneratorInterface` is used.
```php
interface UrlGeneratorInterface
{
    public function getAbsoluteMediaUrl(MediaEntity $media): string;

    public function getRelativeMediaUrl(MediaEntity $media): string;

    public function getAbsoluteThumbnailUrl(MediaEntity $media, MediaThumbnailEntity $thumbnail): string;

    public function getRelativeThumbnailUrl(MediaEntity $media, MediaThumbnailEntity $thumbnail): string;
}

interface PathnameStrategyInterface
{
    public function getName(): string;

    /**
     * Generate a hash, missing from url if omitted
     */
    public function generatePathHash(MediaEntity $media, ?MediaThumbnailEntity $thumbnail = null): ?string;

    /**
     * Generate the cache buster part of the path, missing from url if omitted
     */
    public function generatePathCacheBuster(MediaEntity $media, ?MediaThumbnailEntity $thumbnail = null): ?string;

    /**
     * Generate the filename
     */
    public function generatePhysicalFilename(MediaEntity $media, ?MediaThumbnailEntity $thumbnail = null): string;
}
```","## Decision 
## Decision

The `UrlGeneratorInterface` will be deprecated and its functionality will be merged into the `PathnameStrategyInterface`.

Rationale:
- The URL generation is inherently tied to how the file path is structured, which is the responsibility of the `PathnameStrategyInterface`.
- Having separate interfaces creates unnecessary indirection and increases complexity.
- The pathname strategy already contains all the information needed to generate both the storage path and the public URL.
- This change simplifies the architecture by consolidating path-related logic in one place.

Implementation plan:
1. Add URL generation methods to the `PathnameStrategyInterface`:
   - `generatePublicPath(MediaEntity $media, ?MediaThumbnailEntity $thumbnail = null): string`
   - `generatePublicPathHash(MediaEntity $media, ?MediaThumbnailEntity $thumbnail = null): ?string` (for cache buster in URLs)
2. Mark the `UrlGeneratorInterface` as deprecated
3. Migrate the existing `UrlGenerator` implementations into their corresponding `PathnameStrategy` implementations
4. Update the event subscriber that listens to `media.loaded` to use the strategy interface directly for URL generation
5. Remove dependency on `UrlGeneratorInterface` from media services

Benefits:
- Single source of truth for path and URL generation
- Reduced number of interfaces and services to maintain
- More intuitive API - the strategy that determines where files are stored also determines how they're accessed
- Easier to implement custom strategies as developers only need to implement one interface","## Decision
To address the issues listed above, we will make the following changes to the system:

- The file path will be saved directly to the media entity (and thumbnail) when the file is uploaded.
    - This way we don't have to access the strategy when generating the URL, which might have changed in the meantime.
- We allow to change the file path via API and write it directly when creating the entity
    - This way files can be synchronized directly with an external storage and the path only has to be changed in the entity or given during import.
- To generate the strategy we use new location structs, which can be easily created via a service.
    - So we remove the dependency to the DAL to generate the file path.
- For generating the URL, we implement a new service, which can be operated without entities.
    - The URL generation is more resource efficient and can be done without fully loaded entities.
- The new URL generator uses a new ""cache busting"" system, which writes the updated at timestamp of the media entity as query parameter into the URL.
    - This way the file path can remain the same even if the file is updated. Changes to the entity's meta data will also result in a new URL."
"## Context
We often need a way between the different Shopware versions to provide a one-time update for data. This is currently done on the way to extend an indexer to this logic and then trigger this via a migration. 
This is of course a possible way to enable certain migrations of data, but this migration is also executed again and again when the indexer is executed. 
With certain data this is critical and can lead to system errors. For example, the one-time migration of media path information.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will introduce a dedicated one-time data migration system separate from the indexing process. This system will:

- Provide a new `DataMigration` class that allows defining versioned, idempotent data transformation scripts
- Store executed migration versions in the database to ensure each migration runs only once
- Integrate with the existing migration system to execute during version upgrades
- Support rollback capabilities for failed migrations
- Include a console command to manually trigger and manage data migrations
- Separate concerns by removing one-time data transformations from indexer logic

This approach ensures data migrations are executed exactly once while maintaining system stability and preventing unintended re-execution during regular indexing operations.","## Decision

We implement a new `PostUpdateIndexer`. This is an extension of the `EntityIndexer` and the system can be adapted 1:1. Also, the indexing registration via database migration can be adapted 1:1. 
However, the indexer is not triggered via the `IndexerRegistry` when a full re-index or an entity written event is triggered.
These indexers are only included after the update process.
In addition to the one-time update of the data, we then often also provide a command that can be used to trigger the migration of the data again."

Our current development process uses ['Experimental features'](./2023-05-10-experimental-features.md) to publish features in an early state to gather feedback regarding those features.
During the implementation, developers may encounter challenges related to the effective management of extensive code scattered throughout the platform, particularly in connection with specific experimental features. This codebase fragmentation presents impediments to the tracking, maintenance, and comprehensive understanding of each feature's scope, thereby hindering our development progress.
 
Potential problems:
* Update `stableVersion` property for Prolonged Experiments
    * When a decision is made to extend an experiment, locating all relevant sections of code for updating the property `stableVersion` in `@experimental` annotation becomes a cumbersome task.
* Deprecation of Killed Features
    * Identifying and marking as deprecated the components associated with a deprecated experimental feature is problematic, particularly when multiple experimental features coexist simultaneously within the platform.
    * The ['Experimental features'](./2023-05-10-experimental-features.md) stipulates the ""Killing Feature"" rule, which mandates that a feature must remain within the platform's codebase until the next major version and be appropriately marked as deprecated. However, it is hardly possible to check with current annotation.

In all the above case main problem is detection to which feature belongs experimental code.","## Decision 
## Decision

Introduce a centralized registry for experimental features to improve traceability, maintenance, and lifecycle management of experimental code.

This registry will be a dedicated configuration file (e.g., `experimental-features.yaml`) located in the root of the platform, which contains metadata for each experimental feature:

```yaml
feature_key:
  name: ""Descriptive Name""
  description: ""Brief explanation of the feature purpose""
  introducedVersion: ""6.7.0""
  stableVersion: ""6.8.0"" # can be null if not yet stabilized
  status: ""active"" | ""extended"" | ""deprecated"" | ""killed""
  owners: [""team"", ""or"", ""devs""]
  tags: [""api"", ""admin"", ""performance""]
```

All uses of the `@experimental` annotation must reference a valid `feature_key` from this registry.

The build process or CI pipeline will validate:
- All `@experimental(""feature_key"")` annotations refer to an existing entry in the registry.
- No duplicate `feature_key`s exist.
- Required fields are present and correctly formatted.

Additionally:
- A script/tool will be provided to list all experimental code locations by feature key (via static analysis).
- The registry enables automated checks for deprecation compliance — e.g., ensuring that killed features are marked as deprecated and remain so until the next major version.
- When extending an experiment, only the `stableVersion` field in the registry needs to be updated — no need to search through code.

This decision does not change the runtime behavior of experimental features but significantly improves developer experience, auditability, and governance around experimental code.","## Decision
To address the existing challenges, we propose implementing a refined approach to the use of the `@experimental` annotation. 

The key modifications are as follows:
* Mandatory `feature` property: 
  * Every `@experimental` annotation will now require a mandatory `feature` property. This property is a string that must contain the name of the associated feature.
* Uniform feature Naming: 
  * To enhance code organization and traceability, all sections of code related to a particular feature must use the same feature name in the `feature` property of the `@experimental` annotation.
  * Feature names should follow the conventions.
    * Feature names cannot contain spaces
    * Feature names should be written in `ALL_CAPS`."

In the current implementation, there exists a challenge for extension developers in uniquely identifying payment and shipping methods using identifiers.
This issue is particularly significant for app servers, as it necessitates calls to the Shopware Admin API for the identification of payment and shipping methods based on their respective IDs.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will introduce a unique, human-readable identifier (slug) for payment and shipping methods to simplify integration for extension developers. This slug will be:

- Generated based on the method name using kebab-case
- Guaranteed to be unique within its type (payment or shipping)
- Immutable once created
- Used as the primary identifier in public APIs and app server communications

This approach eliminates the need for repeated Admin API calls to resolve numeric IDs and improves readability and debugging for developers.","## Decision
We will introduce a new property called `technicalName` to both the `payment_method` and `shipping_method` entities.
This `technicalName` property will serve as a unique identifier for payment and shipping methods, significantly simplifying the identification process.

While the `technicalName` field will be optional within the database and API to ensure backward compatibility, it will be made mandatory in the Administration.
This ensures that merchants will update their payment and shipping methods accordingly for the upcoming requirement.
An unique index will ensure uniqueness.
Starting from version 6.7.0.0, this `technicalName` field will also become required within the database and the API.

As part of the database migration process, the `technicalName` field will be automatically generated for the default payment and shipping methods provided by Shopware, as illustrated below:

| Type     | Name             | Technical Name          |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Payment  | Debit            | payment_debitpayment    |
| Payment  | Invoice          | payment_invoicepayment  |
| Payment  | Cash on Delivery | payment_cashpayment     |
| Payment  | Pre Payment      | payment_prepayment      |
| Shipping | Standard         | shipping_standard       |
| Shipping | Express          | shipping_express        |

Furthermore, all payment and shipping methods provided by apps will also benefit from the automatic generation of their `technicalName`.
This generation will be based on the app's name and the `identifier` defined for the payment method in the manifest:

| App Name | Identifier         | Technical Name                    |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| MyApp    | my_payment_method  | payment_MyApp_my_payment_method   |
| MyApp    | my_shipping_method | shipping_MyApp_my_shipping_method |"
"## Context

At the moment the Storefront is implementing a lot of custom SCSS inside `app/storefront/src/scss`.
Some custom SCSS is not necessary, and it already exists within Bootstrap as a utility.
For example default spacing with a custom selector:

```scss
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
    margin-bottom: $spacer;
}
```

This can be replaced with a Bootstrap [spacing utility](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/spacing/) in the HTML and the SCSS can be completely removed:

```diff
- <div class=""register-login-collapse-toogle""><div>
+ <div class=""register-login-collapse-toogle mb-3""><div>
```

A class like `register-login-collapse-toogle` should stay in the HTML in case a developer wants to style this specific element.
But there is no need to introduce a new CSS rule using a custom selector to apply a default spacing.

If you implement new UI using mostly utility classes, please consider to still add CSS classes that offer the possibility for themes to add individual styling. For example:

```html
<!-- Classes ""shipping-modal-actions"", ""shipping-abort"" and ""shipping-submit"" are added for better semantics and CSS extensibility, but ship no default CSS. -->
<div class=""border p-3 mb-3 shipping-modal-actions"">
    <button class=""btn btn-light shipping-abort"">Abort</button>
    <button class=""btn btn-primary shipping-submit"">Submit</button>
</div>
```

This principle cannot be applied everywhere. 
For more complex layouts it can still be valid to use custom SCSS because it is not possible to build with default components and utilities, or it would produce a messy template with too many generic utility classes. 
However, for simpler stuff like ""add a border here, add some spacing there"" it's not necessary to implement additional custom styling.","## Decision 
## Decision

* Favor Bootstrap utility classes over custom SCSS for basic styling such as spacing, borders, visibility, and alignment.
* Remove existing custom SCSS rules that merely replicate Bootstrap utilities (e.g., margin, padding, border) and replace them with the corresponding utility classes in the template.
* Retain semantic class names in HTML to allow theme developers to extend or override styles when needed, even if no custom CSS is applied initially.
* Apply this approach selectively—use custom SCSS only when dealing with complex layouts or behaviors that cannot be achieved cleanly with utilities.
* Enforce this pattern in code reviews and documentation to promote consistency and reduce CSS bloat.","## Decision

We want to make more use of Bootstrap utilities and get rid of custom SCSS that is not needed.

In order to do so we want to remove unneeded SCSS and add a utility class to the HTML instead (e.g. `mb-3`).
However, this can break styling overrides of themes/apps because most Bootstrap utility classes apply `!important` by default.

Let's stick to the example of `.register-login-collapse-toogle`.
* The core Storefront adds a bottom margin of `$spacer` which equals `1rem`.
* Then `CustomTheme` overrides this selector with a margin bottom of `80px`:

```diff
/* CustomTheme */
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
+    margin-bottom: 80px;
}

/* Storefront */
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
-    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

If the core Storefront would migrate to the utility class it would suddenly overrule the styling of `CustomTheme` because of the `!important` property:

```diff
/* Utility class from HTML overrules CustomTheme */
.mb-3 {
+    margin-bottom: 1rem !important;
}

/* CustomTheme */
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
-    margin-bottom: 80px;
}

/* Storefront */
.register-login-collapse-toogle {
-    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

The theme developer would have no other choice other than using `!important` as well, or modifying the Twig template.

Because of this, we have decided to remove the `!important` from Bootstrap utility classes by changing the [Importance](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/api/#importance) variable `$enable-important-utilities` to `false`.
By doing this, we can use more utilities while at the same time allowing themes to override the same CSS property without using `!important` or editing the template.

Since it is currently expected that Bootstrap utilities add `!important` and overrule almost everything, we do not want to change this right away but from `v6.6.0` onwards."
"## Context
For our ambitions to consequently reduce manual testing in favour for test automation the current E2E test suite, based on Cypress, is not sufficient anymore. It has several flaws that have become a big road-blocker. The test suite is tightly coupled to the state of the test environment, which leads to tests that are not very deterministic and tend to be slow and flaky. Tests are often created in different ways and don't follow a specific strategy. In addition, the test suite is currently not able to test against our cloud environment.

Our goal is to create a test suite that fulfills the following requirements:

*  Deterministic tests that can run against any environment.
*  Fast and reliable tests that follow a certain test strategy.
*  Tests that are derived from real product requirements and validate behaviour.
*  A test framework that is easy to learn and using a readable syntax that also non-tech people can comprehend.","## Decision  
## Decision

We will replace the current Cypress-based E2E test suite with a new test automation framework based on **Playwright** and **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** using **Gherkin syntax**.

The decision is based on the following actions:

- **Adopt Playwright** as the primary browser automation tool due to its:
  - Faster execution and resilience to flakiness
  - Better handling of modern web components and dynamic content
  - Support for multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) out of the box
  - Strong API for controlling network traffic and mocking responses
  - Ability to run tests reliably across different environments (including cloud)

- **Introduce BDD with Gherkin (.feature files)** to:
  - Align tests directly with product requirements
  - Enable collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders
  - Improve readability and maintainability through natural language specifications
  - Ensure tests validate actual user behaviour rather than implementation details

- **Implement a clear test strategy** based on:
  - Page Object Model (POM) or Screenplay Pattern for better abstraction and reusability
  - Test data management via factories and seeded state instead of relying on environment state
  - Environment-agnostic configuration allowing execution against local, staging, and cloud environments

- **Establish standards and patterns** including:
  - Centralized command and assertion libraries
  - Tagging mechanism (e.g., `@smoke`, `@regression`, `@cloud`) to enable selective test execution
  - CI/CD integration with parallel execution and automatic retries for increased reliability

This shift will allow us to build a scalable, deterministic, and maintainable E2E test suite that supports our goal of reducing manual testing and increasing confidence in automated validation.","## Decision
In order to achieve this goal we decided to not further invest time in the existing test suite, but start from scratch. This offers the opportunity to also switch to another test framework that better fulfills our needs. 

After some evaluation we chose Playwright as the new test framework. First benchmarks have shown that it is faster and more stable than Cypress. Additionally, it is easy to learn, has very good documentation and uses a syntax that is easily to understand. It also offers the functionality of creating reusable traces, which come in handy when debugging failing tests from pipelines."
"## Context
1. If flow actions want to interact with the database in a transactional manner, they need to handle it themselves by starting and committing transactions.

2. When there is a problem committing the transaction, the error will be caught and ignored by the flow dispatcher. A vague error message will be logged, but the flows will continue to execute.
This is problematic if a transaction was already started before the flow is executed. If the connection is configured without save points (which is the default with Shopware), when a nested commit fails (eg during a flow action) the connection will be marked as rollback only.
When the outer transaction attempts to commit, eg the calling code, it will be unaware of the previous inner commit failure and thus will also fail.","## Decision 
## Decision

Flow actions that perform database operations must not manage transactions directly. Instead, transaction management will be handled at the flow execution level by the flow dispatcher.

To address the issues:

1. **Remove Responsibility from Flow Actions**: Flow actions shall assume they are executing within a managed transaction context. They must not begin or commit transactions themselves. This prevents nested transaction conflicts and aligns with typical ambient transaction patterns.

2. **Transaction Management in Flow Dispatcher**: The flow dispatcher will initiate a single transaction at the beginning of flow execution (if not already within one, depending on propagation behavior). If any action within the flow fails during its database operation, the entire transaction will be marked for rollback.

3. **Proper Error Propagation**: Errors occurring during database commits within flow actions will no longer be silently caught and ignored. Instead, they will be re-thrown or wrapped in a meaningful exception and propagated up, ensuring calling code is aware of failures.

4. **Support for Savepoints (Optional)**: For use cases requiring partial rollback within a flow (e.g., skip a failing action but continue others), we may introduce optional savepoint support. However, this will be disabled by default and require explicit configuration due to complexity and performance overhead.

This change ensures data consistency, avoids silent failures, and prevents outer transactions from being unexpectedly rolled back due to unobserved inner failures. It also simplifies flow action implementation and reduces the risk of incorrect transaction handling.","## Decision

We introduce a new marker interface `\Shopware\Core\Content\Flow\Dispatching\TransactionalAction` which flow actions can implement.

The flow executor will wrap any action in a database transaction which implements the interface.

Before:

```php
class SetOrderStateAction extends FlowAction implements DelayableAction
{
    public function handleFlow(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {
        $this->connection->beginTransaction();
        
        //do stuff
        
        try {
            $this->connection->commit();
        } catch (\Throwable $e) {
                
        }
    }
}
```

After:

```php

class SetOrderStateAction extends FlowAction implements DelayableAction, TransactionalAction
{
    public function handleFlow(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {        
        //do stuff - will be wrapped in a transaction
    }
}
```

You can also force the flow executor to rollback the transaction by throwing an instance of `\Shopware\Core\Content\Flow\Dispatching\TransactionFailedException`. You can use the static `because` method to create the exception from another one. Eg:

```php

class SetOrderStateAction extends FlowAction implements DelayableAction, TransactionalAction
{
    public function handleFlow(StorableFlow $flow): void
    {        
        try {
            //search for some record
            $entity = $this->repo->find(...);
        } catch (NotFoundException $e) {
            throw TransactionFailedException::because($e);
        }
    }
}
```

The transaction will be rollback if either of the following are true:

1. If Doctrine throws an instance of `Doctrine\DBAL\Exception` during commit.
2. If the action throws an instance of `TransactionFailedException` during execution.
3. If another non-handled exception is thrown during the action execution. This is to aid debugging.

If the transaction fails, then the error will be logged. Also, if the transaction has been performed inside a nested transaction without save points enabled, the exception will be rethrown.
So that the calling code knows something went wrong and is able to handle it correctly, by rolling back instead of committing. As, in this instance, the connection will be marked as rollback only."

Vue 3 introduced a new compatibility mode to ease the migration from Vue 2 to Vue 3. This mode is enabled by default
and allows the use of most Vue 2 features in a Vue 3 application. This mode is only recommended for the transition period
and should be turned off as soon as possible.

We have kept the compatibility mode enabled in the administration because it makes it easier for plugins to migrate 
and results in fewer breaking changes during the major release. This splits the work of migrating the administration
and the plugins into two separate majors instead of one.","## Decision 
## Decision
We will keep the Vue 3 compatibility mode enabled for the initial major release (e.g., v6.5) to minimize breaking changes and reduce migration effort for plugin developers. This allows us to focus on core framework upgrades in this release while deferring full Vue 3 adoption (e.g., Composition API usage, removal of deprecated options API patterns) to a subsequent major version.

Disabling compatibility mode will be part of a dedicated follow-up major release, where we will:
- Migrate remaining components from Options API to Composition API
- Remove usage of deprecated Vue 2 features
- Enforce new Vue 3 best practices via ESLint rules
- Provide comprehensive migration guides for plugins

This staged approach reduces risk, improves developer experience, and ensures ecosystem stability during the transition.","## Decision

Migrating all components in one by disabling the compatibility mode for the whole administration is a huge task and
would make it hard to keep the administration stable during the migration. We decided to disable the compatibility mode
per component level. This allows us to migrate components one by one and keep the administration stable during the migration.

This gives all teams and plugin developers the possibility to migrate their components to Vue 3 without waiting for the
whole administration to be migrated and for the global removal of the compatibility mode.

To activate the new mode, the `DISABLE_VUE_COMPAT` feature flag must be enabled. Then, it is possible to disable the
compatibility mode on a per-component level by setting the `compatConfig` option in the component to our custom configuration.
This custom configuration is exposed in `Shopware.compatConfig` and has all compatibility features disabled if the 
feature flag is activated."

It was brought to our attention that the latest version of Vuex `4.1.0` contains a bug that destroys getter reactivity under specific circumstances. The proposed fix was to downgrade to `4.0.2`.

## Decision
We will stay on Vuex `4.1.0` and apply a local workaround in affected modules to restore getter reactivity. The workaround involves restructuring the computed dependencies and ensuring getters are accessed within appropriate lifecycle hooks to maintain reactivity.

In our current architecture, we rely heavily on PHP decoration, Adapter, and Factory patterns to allow for extensions and customizations by third-party developers. While these patterns are effective, they present significant challenges:

1. **Backward and Forward Compatibility:**
    - Maintaining backward and forward compatibility with these patterns is complex and labor-intensive. Each change or update can potentially break existing extensions or require extensive rework to ensure compatibility.

2. **Process Extension Limitations:**
    - These patterns do not inherently allow for the extension of subprocesses unless these subprocesses are extracted into separate classes and interfaces. This extraction often results in a proliferation of interfaces, abstract classes, and their implementations.

3. **Proliferation of Code:**
    - The need to extract subprocesses into separate entities leads to an overwhelming number of interfaces and abstract classes. This proliferation makes the codebase more difficult to understand and maintain, and increases the cognitive load on developers.","## Decision  
## Decision

To reduce complexity and improve maintainability, we will **limit the use of decoration, Adapter, and Factory patterns** in new code unless strictly necessary for core extensibility (e.g., public API integrations).

Instead, we will favor **explicit composition and clear service boundaries** with well-defined interfaces only where extension is a documented requirement. Subprocesses should not be extracted solely to support theoretical extensibility.

For cases where third-party extension is required, we will:
- Prefer event-driven or hook-based extension mechanisms over inheritance and decoration.
- Provide dedicated extension points via plugins or registries, rather than relying on class-level overrides.

This shift aims to reduce interface bloat, simplify refactoring, and make the codebase more approachable while still supporting essential customization needs.","## Decision

To address these challenges, we have decided to transition to an event-based extension system. This new approach will replace the existing decoration, Adapter, and Factory patterns as the primary method for extending and customizing our system."

## Decision

We will introduce a new Jest runner configuration that disables Vue Test Utils' compat mode. This runner will be used for components that are migrated to the composition API and no longer rely on legacy Vue 2 behavior. 

New component tests must use the new runner with compat mode disabled. Existing tests can remain under the current setup until they are refactored, ensuring a gradual and safe migration. This approach allows us to enforce modern best practices while maintaining backward compatibility during the transition.","## Decision

I added a new runner command in the NPM scripts to run the Jest tests without compat mode. The new runner command is
`unit:disabled-compat` and `unit-watch:disabled-compat`. Also, the composer commands are added to run the tests. These commands are `admin:unit:disabled-compat` and `admin:unit-watch:disabled-compat`. These commands are using the environment variable `DISABLE_JEST_COMPAT_MODE` to disable the compat mode.

For the pipeline, I added a new stage to run the Jest tests without compat mode. The stage is `Jest (Administration with disabled compat mode)`.

To mark a test file working without the compat mode you need to add a comment with the `@group` tag. The tag is `@group disabledCompat`.

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * @package admin
 * @group disabledCompat
 */

import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils';

async function createWrapper() {
...
```

With this tag, the test file is running without compat mode. To make a component working for both modes, you can use the
compatUtils helper function from Vue compat:
```javascript
// Example
import { compatUtils } from '@vue/compat';

...

if (compatUtils.isCompatEnabled('INSTANCE_LISTENERS')) {
    return this.$listeners;
}

return {};

...
```


Important: the test still runs also with compat mode activated in parallel."

In some instances, a system rollout was completed where an error in certain system functionalities was not detected until the system was live.

A software system is made up of many components that work together to provide a service. The software system can still be healthy even if some of its components are not fully in a healthy state.  System health checks are a way to monitor the health of a system and detect failures early.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will implement comprehensive health checks at both the system and component levels to improve early detection of failures before and after deployment. These health checks will be categorized as:

* **Liveness Probe**: Determines if the application is running. If this fails, the system should restart the service.
* **Readiness Probe**: Determines if the application is ready to accept traffic. If this fails, the service should be removed from the load balancer rotation.
* **Startup Probe**: Determines if the application has started successfully, particularly useful for services with long initialization times.

Each major component (e.g., database, message queue, external APIs) will have targeted health indicators that reflect connectivity, responsiveness, and functional correctness. These checks will be exposed via a standardized `/health` endpoint in JSON format, detailing the status of each component as `Healthy`, `Degraded`, or `Unhealthy`.

Health check results will be integrated into monitoring and alerting systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, PagerDuty) to ensure immediate visibility into issues during rollouts. Additionally, pre-deployment pipelines will include health check validation in staging environments to catch configuration or dependency issues prior to production release.

This approach ensures faster detection of partial failures, reduces time-to-detection of critical bugs, and supports safer rollouts through automated feedback loops.","## Decision

The `Shopware\Core\Test\PHPUnit\Extension\FeatureFlag\Subscriber\TestPreparationStartedSubscriber` only allows

The restriction to only consider the `Shopware\Tests\Unit` namespace in the `TestPreparationStartedSubscriber` for enabling major features is too narrow and may hinder test flexibility and maintainability. We decide to broaden the scope by allowing additional namespaces, such as `Shopware\Tests\Integration` and other relevant test suites, to also be eligible for major feature flag activation.

This change ensures consistent behavior across different test types (unit, integration, etc.) when testing feature-flagged code paths. The extension should evaluate the test context or configuration rather than relying solely on namespace heuristics.

If needed, a configuration mechanism (e.g., via PHPUnit XML or environment variables) will be introduced to allow fine-grained control over which test suites can enable major features, ensuring both flexibility and safety.","## Decision

To be able to unit test the upcoming major feature in other plugins we will enable the possibility to add other
namespaces to
the `Shopware\Core\Test\PHPUnit\Extension\FeatureFlag\Subscriber\TestPreparationStartedSubscriber`.

We'll add a static method called `addNamespace()` method to the
`Shopware\Core\Test\PHPUnit\Extension\FeatureFlag\FeatureFlagExtension` and by this we are able to add other namespaces
to the allowlist of the namespaces to be considered when enabling the major flags in the unit test suite.

This can be useful for plugins that wants to enable the major flags in their unit tests suite.

Therefore, add the extension to the extension list in the `phpunit.xml`:

```xml

Our Vue.js application currently uses the Options API, which is the traditional way of writing Vue components in Vue 2. With the release of Vue 3, the Composition API was introduced, offering improved code organization, better TypeScript support, and enhanced reusability of component logic. For more detailed information about the reasons for migrating to the Composition API, see the [documentation entry](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/administration/system-updates/vue-native.html).

To modernize our codebase and take advantage of these benefits, we need to migrate our existing Vue 2 Options API components to use the Vue 3 Composition API. Manual conversion of numerous components would be time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, we need an automated solution to assist in this migration process.","## Decision  
## Decision

We will use the automated migration tool [vue-2to3](https://github.com/znck/vue-2-to-3) to convert our Vue 2 Options API components to the Composition API syntax compatible with Vue 3. This tool provides a reliable and efficient way to transform existing component options (e.g., `data`, `methods`, `computed`, `watch`) into their equivalent Composition API counterparts using `setup()`.

The migration will be executed incrementally, module by module, to minimize disruption and allow for thorough testing. After automated conversion, each component will undergo manual review and refinement to ensure:

- Logical grouping of related logic in `setup()`
- Proper usage of `ref`, `reactive`, `computed`, and other Composition API utilities
- Correct TypeScript typing
- Removal of deprecated patterns or workarounds no longer needed

Additionally, we will establish a set of internal coding guidelines for new components, mandating the use of the Composition API and `script setup` syntax where applicable. This ensures consistency across the codebase moving forward.

By automating the bulk of the transformation and combining it with targeted manual improvements, we achieve a scalable, maintainable path toward full Vue 3 readiness while improving code quality and developer experience.","## Decision

We have decided to implement a Codemod in the form of an ESLint rule to automatically convert Vue 2 Options API components to Vue 3 Composition API. This Codemod will:

1. Identify Vue component definitions in the codebase.
2. Convert the following Options API features to their Composition API equivalents:
    - Convert `data` properties to `ref` or `reactive`.
    - Convert `computed` properties to `computed()` functions.
    - Convert `methods` to regular functions within the `setup()` function.
    - Convert lifecycle hooks to their Composition API equivalents (e.g., `mounted` to `onMounted`).
    - Convert Vue 2 specific lifecycle hooks to their Vue 3 equivalents.
    - Convert `watch` properties to `watch()` functions.
    - Handle `props` and `inject` conversions.
    - Replace `this` references with direct references to reactive variables.
    - Convert writable computed properties.
    - Handle reactive object reassignments using `Object.assign`
    - Handle correct usage of `ref` and replace the access to the value with `.value`.

3. Generate a `setup()` function containing the converted code.
4. Add necessary imports for Composition API functions (e.g., `ref`, `reactive`, `computed`, `watch`).

The Codemod will be implemented as an ESLint rule to leverage the existing ESLint ecosystem and allow for easy integration into our development workflow."
"## Context
The current block system relies on TwigJs for creating reusable and extendable component template.
This system allows plugin developers to override or extend content in predefined blocks using TwigJsÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂ¯s inheritance mechanisms. Vue.js offers a more dynamic and reactive component-based architecture which is better suited for modern frontend development.

To replace TwigJs with a native Vue.js approach we need to introduce two new component `sw-block` and `sw-block-parent`.

The new `sw-block` and `sw-block-parent` components in Vue.js aim to replicate and improve on the TwigJs block system by providing a component-based approach. These components offer enhanced flexibility by allowing dynamic content overriding and extension directly in VueÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂ¯s templating and reactivity model.","## Decision  
## Decision

We will replace the current TwigJs-based block system with a native Vue.js solution using two new components: `sw-block` and `sw-block-parent`. This shift aligns with our goal of modernizing the administration frontend by leveraging Vue.js’s reactivity, component composition, and template flexibility.

The `sw-block-parent` component will define named slots (blocks) that can be dynamically filled or overridden. The `sw-block` component will allow plugin developers to target and replace specific blocks by name, enabling both full replacement and content extension (e.g., via prepend/append behavior simulated through ordering and slotting).

This Vue-native approach offers several advantages:
- Full integration with Vue’s reactivity system.
- Improved performance by eliminating the need for TwigJs parsing at runtime.
- Better developer experience through standard Vue templates and tooling support (e.g., IDE autocomplete, linting).
- Easier debugging and maintainability compared to string-based template inheritance.

Plugins will register their `sw-block` components globally or locally, targeting existing block names declared by `sw-block-parent`. A registration mechanism (e.g., via a block registry or component resolver) will ensure overrides are applied correctly at render time.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Loss of exact Twig-style inheritance syntax, which some developers may already be familiar with.
- Requires migration of all existing TwigJs blocks to Vue components.
- Slightly more complexity in managing dynamic component resolution.

However, the long-term benefits in performance, maintainability, and alignment with modern frontend practices justify this change.","## Decision
We have decided to migrate from the TwigJs-based block system to the Vue.js-based `sw-block` system. This decision aligns with the following goals:

1. **Uniform Frontend Stack**: Vue.js is already used for the frontend in Shopware Administration. Moving blocks from TwigJs to Vue.js creates consistency in the technology stack, simplifying development and reducing the cognitive load on developers who previously had to switch between TwigJs and Vue.js.

2. **Improved Flexibility**: With Vue.js blocks we have control over the provided access to the componentÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂ¯s internals, allowing for more granular control over block behavior and content. This allows us to create a public API for any component, making it easier to extend and modify internal behavior, without breaking the public API."
"## Context

Currently, all product prices that are displayed in the default Storefront have an asterisk `*` next to them, for example: `ÃÂÃÂ 50,00 *`
This asterisk refers to the tax and shipping costs information in the page footer `* All prices incl. VAT plus shipping costs and possible delivery charges, if not stated otherwise.`

Using the asterisk `*` next to every price has several downsides that we want to address:","## Decision  
## Decision

Replace the universal asterisk `*` next to all prices with a contextual, interactive tooltip that displays tax and shipping information on demand.

**Rationale:**
- The current use of `*` next to every price is visually noisy and draws excessive attention, especially when multiple prices are shown on a single page.
- Users often overlook footer disclaimers, reducing transparency and potentially causing confusion at checkout.
- A tooltip provides a cleaner UI while improving accessibility and user experience by offering immediate, clear context when needed.
- The solution supports future flexibility (e.g., dynamic content per region or customer group).

**Implementation:**
- Remove the asterisk `*` from all price displays in the Storefront.
- Introduce a standardized, accessible `(i)` icon or ""Info"" link near pricing sections that triggers a tooltip/modal with the full message:  
  _""All prices include VAT. Shipping costs and possible delivery charges apply unless otherwise stated.""_  
- Ensure the tooltip is keyboard-navigable, screen-reader friendly, and translatable via snippet system.
- Apply this pattern consistently across product listings, detail pages, cart, and checkout summaries.

This change improves clarity, reduces visual clutter, and aligns with modern UX best practices.","## Decision

The asterisk `*` next to every price will be removed because of the reasons mentioned above.
In most areas of the Storefront, the information that the asterisk `*` refers to is already given, and it is therefore redundant.
In areas where the asterisk `*` was actually needed, it will be replaced by the actual text ""Prices incl. VAT plus shipping costs"" instead to resolve the accessibility issues."
"## Context

To comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), we aim to make Shopware 6's document solution accessible (A11y-compliant). This ensures that our solution remains usable while meeting legal requirements and making documents accessible to customers with disabilities. 

Currently, our PDF generation library, DomPDF, does not meet accessibility standards, posing a significant challenge.","## Decision 
## Decision

Replace DomPDF with an accessible PDF generation library that supports WCAG compliance, such as **TCPDF** or **mPDF**, both of which offer better support for generating tagged, structured, and semantic PDFs required for accessibility. Additionally, implement proper document structure (headings, lists, alternative text for images, reading order) in the generated documents and ensure color contrast meets AA standards. Conduct regular accessibility audits on generated documents to maintain compliance.","## Decision

We have decided to make HTML documents available in addition to PDF documents, as these are more accessible.

- **Better for Accessibility**: HTML is naturally organized, making it easier for accessibility tools to read and present content to people with disabilities.

- **Lack of Support**: As our current PDFs lack support for accessibility. Few tools, especially in PHP, can create accessible tagged PDFs, making it difficult to maintain PDF accessibility.

- **Industry Trends**: Many organizations are already moving from PDFs to HTML for accessibility. For example, government websites have been required to meet accessibility standards since the early 2000s. Most of them now use HTML for most of their content because it meets these standards better.

Providing HTML documents aligns with these trends and ensures we are using best practices for accessibility."
"## Context
The existing rule system is flexible but complex, making it difficult to evolve and maintain. Allowing unrestricted extensions of rule classes slows down improvements and increases the complexity of the system.

See RFC: https://github.com/shopware/shopware/discussions/5785","## Decision 
## Decision

To improve maintainability and enable future enhancements of the rule system, we restrict direct inheritance of core `Rule` classes. Third-party developers must not extend or override core rule implementations, as this creates tight coupling and hinders refactoring.

Instead, custom rule logic must be implemented using one of the following supported extension mechanisms:

- **App-provided script rules** using the `app_script_condition` entity with Twig-based evaluation (as defined in the scripting RFC).
- **Custom rule definitions** via the service tag `shopware.rule.definition`, which are registered independently and do not inherit from core rules.
- **Generic conditions with configuration** using `RuleConfig`, allowing UI abstraction in the administration without requiring new Vue components.

This approach ensures a stable public API for rules while enabling extensibility. Core rule classes may evolve internally without breaking third-party code. Existing extensions that rely on inheritance will be deprecated and must migrate to one of the supported patterns.","## Decision
We will mark existing rule classes as internal, limiting direct usage by third parties. Developers should create new rule classes instead of modifying existing ones. 

Nearly all rule classes will be marked as internal, with a few exceptions: 

```
LineItemOfTypeRule
LineItemProductStatesRule
PromotionCodeOfTypeRule
ZipCodeRule
BillingZipCodeRule
ShippingZipCodeRule
```

These classes will remain public for now, because they rely on configuration which is reasonably expected to be extended by third-party developers."
"## Context

The Storefront JavaScript currently offers a helper class `src/helper/iterator.helper.js` that can iterate over different objects like Maps, FormData, plain arrays etc.
Using this approach has several downsides we want to address.

* It creates an unnecessary abstraction over the native alternative. Very often the `Iterator.iterate()` directly uses js plain `forEach` loop without any additional logic. Using the abstraction is actually creating more complexity.
* It prevents the developer from using the appropriate loop for the given data type and instead passes it to an iterator that does it with arbitrary data types.
* The iterator is a special shopware syntax that needs to be understood and documented. It is way easier to use web standards that everyone knows and that is also officially documented already.
* The usage throughout the codebase is inconsistent and the iterator helper is used alongside the native loops which can create confusion.
* It creates the impression that the data that is being iterated is some special custom object that needs a special iterator helper. In reality, it is a simple `NodeList` in 90% of the time.
* It creates an additional dependency/import in every file that is using it.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will remove the `src/helper/iterator.helper.js` and replace all usages with native JavaScript iteration methods.

* Developers should use built-in iteration mechanisms such as:
  * `for...of` loops for iterable objects (Arrays, NodeLists, Maps, Sets)
  * `forEach()` for Arrays when side effects are intended
  * `for...in` for object properties (with caution and proper filtering)
  * `Object.entries()`, `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()` for plain objects
* This aligns the codebase with modern JavaScript standards and improves readability and maintainability.
* It reduces unnecessary abstractions and dependencies.
* It leverages widely known language features, reducing the learning curve for new developers.
* Code reviews will ensure that the appropriate iteration method is used based on the data type and use case.","## Decision

For all the above reasons we have decided to deprecate `src/helper/iterator.helper.js`, stop using it, and use native alternatives instead.
We want to have a more lean and simple Storefront JavaScript that needs less special things to learn and understand."
"## Context

Currently, flows are executed during the business process. A business
process is any event that is triggered by the user, like a checkout or
a product update. Flows are used to react to these events and execute user defined actions.

There are several downsides to this approach. The most straightforward is the possibility of a fatal error during
the execution of any flow. This will inevitably cancel the in progress business process. While there are remedies in place
to avoid any trivial errors in flow execution disrupting the business process, certain errors can not be avoided.

Further, even if all flows execute without error, they noticeably impact business process performance. Flows are often 
employed to, for example, send mails, an expensive operation that is not necessary to complete the business process.

In addition to these concrete disadvantages, there are also some more abstract ones. For one, currently flows are executed directly
from a decorator of Symfony's `EventDispatcher`, leading to cumbersome debugging and bloated stack traces. This would
be improved if flows are executed by a dedicated event listener. Additionally moving flows to their own execution
environment would not only simplify debugging, but also potentially make expanding their capabilities easier.

> *The following is all experimental and only takes effect if the associated feature flag `FLOW_EXECUTION_AFTER_BUSINESS_PROCESS` is enabled*","## Decision 
## Decision

Flows will be decoupled from the business process and executed asynchronously after its completion.

Instead of executing flows synchronously during event propagation, they will be collected during the business process and dispatched to a message queue for deferred execution. This change ensures that:

- Flow execution failures do not interrupt or roll back the business process.
- Performance of core business operations is no longer affected by potentially slow flow actions (e.g., sending emails, external API calls).
- Error handling and retries can be managed independently for flows, increasing resilience.

Implementation approach:
- During the business process, matching flows are resolved and their definitions (flow ID, triggering event, context data) are serialized and enqueued via a message bus (e.g., Symfony Messenger).
- A dedicated message handler (e.g., `ExecuteFlowMessageHandler`) processes these messages asynchronously, instantiates the respective flow, and executes it in isolation.
- This handler is registered as a consumer in a worker queue system, allowing scalability and monitoring.

To support gradual rollout and testing:
- The behavior is guarded by the feature flag `FLOW_EXECUTION_AFTER_BUSINESS_PROCESS`.
- When disabled, flows continue to execute synchronously as before.
- When enabled, flows are queued and executed post-process.

Benefits:
- Improved reliability: Business processes complete successfully regardless of flow outcomes.
- Better performance: Core transactions are faster and more predictable.
- Simplified debugging: Flow execution is isolated and visible as a separate step in logs and traces.
- Future extensibility: Enables features like flow scheduling, prioritization, and audit logging.

This change aligns with best practices for handling side effects in domain-driven systems and prepares the architecture for event-driven scalability.","## Decision


We will move the flow execution after the business process. As outlined above we believe that this will simplify the
development around flows, while also improving their performance and safeguarding the main execution environment.

To ensure that flows are executed as close to the business process that triggered them as possible, we will
'queue' the flow execution. This means that flows will be executed after the business process has finished.
Flows are stored in memory and executed as soon as the execution environment signals, that it has
finished a unit of work. The associated events are as follows:

1. After a controller action has been executed (Web) => `KernelEvents::TERMINATE`
2. After a queued message has been processed (Queue) => `WorkerMessageHandledEvent`
3. After a command has been executed (CLI) => `ConsoleEvents::TERMINATE`

Another option would be to handle flow executions as queue messages. This would entirely remove
flow executions from the runtime of the business process. While this would be a simpler solution,
it would both make debugging more complex and introduce an unpredictable delay between the business
process and the flow execution. While this delay could be mitigated by using a high priority queue,
it could not reliably be kept under a certain threshold. To entirely avoid this delay, we decided
that the flow execution should be handled as close to the business process as possible."

"## Context and Problem Statement

The Metadata API provides a modern Python API for accessing individual pieces
of metadata. It does not provide any wider context help to someone looking to
implement a TUF repository.

The legacy python-tuf implementation offers tools for this but suffers from
some issues (as do many other implementations):
* There is a _very_ large amount of code to maintain: repo.py,
  repository_tool.py and repository_lib.py alone are almost 7000 lines of code.
* The ""library like"" parts of the implementation do not form a good coherent
  API: methods routinely have a large number of arguments, code still depends
  on globals in a major way and application (repo.py) still implements a lot of
  ""repository code"" itself
* The ""library like"" parts of the implementation make decisions that look like
  application decisions. As an example, repository_tool loads _every_ metadata
  file in the repository: this is fine for CLI that operates on a small
  repository but is unlikely to be a good choice for a large scale server.","## Decision  
## Decision

We will design and implement a new **Repository Toolkit API** that provides composable, modular, and context-aware utilities for building and managing TUF repositories, while clearly separating concerns between low-level metadata operations and high-level repository workflows.

Key decisions:

- **Separation of Concerns**: The Metadata API remains focused on reading, writing, and validating individual metadata files. The new Repository Toolkit handles higher-level operations such as role rotation, expiration management, snapshot creation, and consistent snapshots.
  
- **Composability over Monoliths**: Instead of a single, stateful repository class managing all aspects of a TUF repo, the toolkit provides small, stateless functions and classes that can be combined based on use case (e.g., CLI tooling vs. automated signing service vs. large-scale mirror).

- **Lazy and Selective Loading**: Avoid loading all metadata at startup. Metadata is loaded on-demand or through explicit traversal APIs, enabling efficient operation in large repositories.

- **No Global State**: Eliminate reliance on global variables. All operations take explicit parameters and dependencies are injected, improving testability and reusability.

- **Application-Agnostic Design**: The toolkit avoids making application-specific assumptions (e.g., ""always sign timestamp after snapshot""). Instead, it exposes atomic actions so callers can implement their own policies.

- **Targeted Use Cases**: Initial focus on supporting common patterns like offline root rotation, delegated role management, and automated repository updates — with clear extension points for custom logic.

This approach allows developers to build robust TUF repository implementations without inheriting unnecessary complexity, while preserving flexibility for both simple and advanced use cases.","## Decision Drivers

* There is a consensus on removing the legacy code from python-tuf due to
  maintainability issues
* Metadata API makes modifying metadata far easier than legacy code base: this
  makes significantly different designs possible
* Not providing a ""repository library"" (and leaving implementers on their own)
  may be a short term solution because of the previous point, but to make
  adoption easier and to help adopters create safe implementations the project
  would benefit from some shared repository code and a shared repository design 
* Maintainability of new library code must be a top concern
* Allowing a wide range of repository implementations (from CLI tools to
  minimal in-memory implementations to large scale application servers)
  would be good: unfortunately these can have wildly differing requirements"

Primer React components was originally released without TypeScript type definitions, making it difficult for engineers to consume the library in TypeScript applications. In [July 2019](https://github.com/primer/react/commit/2983c935ea9ad600c04078adb25e40c3624c11fa#diff-7aa4473ede4abd9ec099e87fec67fd57afafaf39e05d493ab4533acc38547eb8), we created an [ambient declaration](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/typescript-ambients-declaration/) file (`index.d.ts`) file to provide type definitions for TypeScript applications without having to rewrite Primer React components in TypeScript.

`index.d.ts` has been an effective stopgap, enabling teams to build complex applications with Primer React components and TypeScript. However, because `index.d.ts` is disconnected from the implementation code, we've struggled to keep the type definitions up-to-date and accurate, as evidenced by [many](https://github.com/primer/react/issues/906) [TypeScript](https://github.com/primer/react/issues/540) [bug](https://github.com/primer/react/issues/520) [reports](https://github.com/primer/react/issues/534). As the library continues to grow in size and complexity, manually maintaining type definitions will become unsustainable.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will migrate Primer React components from JavaScript to TypeScript, removing the need for manually maintained ambient type definitions (`index.d.ts`). This ensures type safety, improves developer experience, and aligns types with implementation, reducing discrepancies and maintenance overhead.

The migration will be done incrementally, file by file, to minimize disruption. Each converted file will be validated for type correctness and backward compatibility. The existing `index.d.ts` will be removed once all relevant files are migrated and types are fully derived from the implementation.","## Decision

We will rewrite Primer React components in TypeScript."
"## Context

In Primer React and consuming applications, we use many different patterns for creating React components. Two common patterns are:

1. Creating components with styled-components

   ```tsx
   const Avatar = styled.img.attrs<StyledAvatarProps>(props => ({
     height: props.size,
     width: props.size,
   }))<StyledAvatarProps>`
     display: inline-block;
     overflow: hidden;
     line-height: ${get('lineHeights.condensedUltra')};
     border-radius: ${props => getBorderRadius(props)};
     ${sx}
   `
   ```

   [Show full code example ÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂº](https://github.com/primer/react/pull/2019/files?diff=split&w=0)

2. Creating components with Box

   ```tsx
   const Avatar: React.FC<AvatarProps> = ({size = 20, alt = '', square = false, sx = {}, ...props}) => {
     const styles: BetterSystemStyleObject = {
       display: 'inline-block',
       overflow: 'hidden',
       lineHeight: 'condensedUltra',
       borderRadius: getBorderRadius({size, square}),
     }

     return (
       <Box
         as=""img""
         alt={alt}
         sx={merge<BetterSystemStyleObject>(styles, sx)} // styles needs to merge with props.sx
         {...props}
       />
     )
   }
   ```

   [Show full code example ÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂº](https://github.com/primer/react/pull/2019/files?diff=split&w=0)

&nbsp;","## Decision 
## Decision

We will standardize on using **Box with `sx` prop** as the preferred pattern for creating React components in Primer and consuming applications.

### Rationale

- **Consistency**: Using Box provides a uniform API across components, reducing cognitive load.
- **Theming**: The `sx` prop integrates seamlessly with our design system tokens (via `get()` functions).
- **Flexibility**: Box supports the `as` prop for element polymorphism and spreads remaining props naturally.
- **Tree Shaking**: Unlike styled-components which can hinder tree shaking, Box is a lightweight utility component.
- **Type Safety**: Works well with TypeScript and provides better autocomplete support.
- **Performance**: Avoids CSS-in-JS runtime overhead from styled-components.

### Migration Approach

1. New components should use the Box pattern
2. Existing styled-components will be migrated incrementally during maintenance
3. We will provide codemods to assist with large-scale migrations when needed

### Example Usage

```tsx
const Avatar: React.FC<AvatarProps> = ({size = 20, alt = '', square = false, sx = {}, ...props}) => {
  const styles: BetterSystemStyleObject = {
    display: 'inline-block',
    overflow: 'hidden',
    lineHeight: 'condensedUltra',
    borderRadius: getBorderRadius({size, square}),
  }

  return (
    <Box
      as=""img""
      alt={alt}
      sx={merge<BetterSystemStyleObject>(styles, sx)}
      {...props}
    />
  )
}
```

styled-components usage will be reserved only for cases requiring advanced CSS features not supported by the `sx` prop.","## Decision

Prefer using method #2: Creating components with Box for the following reasons:

- Better authoring experience with Typescript. With Box, we can improve the API and autocomplete for consuming primitives. [See research](https://github.com/github/primer/discussions/755#discussioncomment-2318144)
- The styling library (i.e. styled-components) becomes an implementation detail and can be changed later with minimal breaking changes for consumers. (Avoids leaky abstractions)
- We have had issues with exporting types, we can increase confidence by keeping the exported types close to what we author.

"## Context

`Drafts` were introduced in [ADR-006](./adrs/adr-006-drafts.md) as a way of creating components outside of the root bundle of `@primer/react`. This helps us create, test and maintain multiple versions of the same component in parallel.

Example:

```js
// default version of component exported from root of package
import {UnderlineNav} from '@primer/react'

// new version of component exported from /drafts
import {UnderlineNav} from '@primer/react/drafts'
```

We have also used this method for components that are still a work in progress and we don't want developers to start using them in production without collaborating with us first.

Example:

```js
// this component only exists in drafts and not in the roof of the package
import {TreeView} from '@primer/react/drafts'
```","## Decision 
## Decision

We will continue using the `drafts` directory to:

1. Develop new versions of existing components in parallel with the stable versions.
2. Host experimental or work-in-progress components that are not yet ready for public production use.

Access to components within `@primer/react/drafts` is considered unstable and subject to breaking changes without following semver. Consumers must opt-in explicitly and acknowledge that usage is at their own risk.

We will document clear contribution and promotion guidelines for moving components from `drafts` to the main export.","## Decision

We should drop the `draft` label and use `experimental` instead.

While not completely accurate (UnderlineNav2 is much more polished than `experimental` maturity), the lack of confusion makes it a good trade-off.

Fine-grained information about component maturity, useful for maintainers, is also communicated by the [status checklist in the component documentation](https://primer.style/react/drafts/UnderlineNav2#status)."
"## Context

[Snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing) is a strategy that allows a developer to ""snapshot"" a given value within a test suite. This value could be a primitive within JavaScript, an Array, an object, or the resulting HTML of rendering a component in React. The snapshot of the value is stored within the repo and is then compared against future test runs.

When a change is detected to a snapshot, the test will fail with a diff between the currently stored snapshot and the new snapshot. Within the space of React components, this may happen when a class name changes or the markup of a component changes. Is is then up to the developer to decide if the change is intentional and whether or not to accept this new snapshot as the baseline for future test runs.

A common practice is to snapshot a React component which will capture the HTML output of rendering a component. For example:

```jsx
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer'
import Link from '../Link'

it('renders correctly', () => {
  const tree = renderer.create(<Link page=""http://www.facebook.com"">Facebook</Link>).toJSON()
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot()
})
```

```js
exports[`renders correctly 1`] = `
<a
  className=""normal""
  href=""http://www.facebook.com""
  onMouseEnter={[Function]}
  onMouseLeave={[Function]}
>
  Facebook
</a>
`
```

[Source](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing#snapshot-testing-with-jest)

As the number of snapshots within a project grows, there are a couple of challenges that emerge:

- Components with wide or deep trees emit large snapshots
- Debugging what change lead to a broken snapshot can be difficult
- It is unclear what the intent may be of a snapshot test when something does fail, in other words it does not always answer the question: what is this testing?","## Decision 
## Decision

We will limit the use of snapshot testing to high-value use cases and avoid using it for large or deeply nested component trees.

Instead, we will favor explicit assertions that clearly express the intent of the test, such as checking specific props, rendered text, or DOM structure attributes.

Snapshot testing may still be used in the following scenarios:
- Configuration objects or constants that are unlikely to change frequently
- Small, stable UI components where the entire output is relevant and intentional
- Preventing unintentional breaking changes in public APIs or exported markup

When snapshots are used, they must be:
- Clearly named to reflect their purpose
- Kept small and focused (e.g., by snapshotting only the relevant part of a render result)
- Reviewed carefully in code reviews to ensure changes are intentional

This approach improves test maintainability, readability, and reduces noise from irrelevant changes while preserving the benefits of regression detection where most effective.","## Decision

- Avoid using ""catch-all"" snapshot tests for React components
- Snapshots may be used for static objects which have a clear signal as to what to do if they are modified (such as the exports of a package)

There are situations where we would like to provide warnings to developers who
use `@primer/react` that something may be deprecated, unsupported, etc. Often,
these will be emitted using `console.warn()`. When using `console.warn()` by
itself, we run into a situation where code that is only meant for development
is included in production code. As a result, it would be helpful to establish
patterns around how to provide warnings to developers in order to make sure
that:

- Calls to `console.warn()` do not appear in production
- Code related to development checks, warnings, or messages are removed from
  production code","## Decision 
## Decision

We will use a dedicated utility function, `devWarning`, to wrap all development-only warnings. This function will conditionally invoke `console.warn()` only in non-production environments (e.g., when `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`).

Additionally, we will leverage webpack's `DefinePlugin` (or equivalent bundler feature) to statically replace environment checks during the build process. This ensures that calls to `devWarning` and associated messages are completely tree-shaken from production bundles, reducing bundle size and preventing any accidental leakage of internal guidance.

Example usage:
```ts
function devWarning(componentName: string, message: string) {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
    console.warn(`[@primer/react] ${componentName}: ${message}`);
  }
}
```

All deprecation notices, unsupported API warnings, or developmental guidance must go through this mechanism to ensure clean production output.","## Decision

Code that is meant for development-only warnings or checks **must** be wrapped within a
`__DEV__` block.

```tsx
function ExampleComponent() {
  if (__DEV__) {
    // This code only runs in development
  }
}
```

Under-the-hood, the `__DEV__` block will be compiled to a `NODE_ENV` check so
that it is stripped when `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`.

> **Note**
> Contributors may wrap hooks within a `__DEV__` block even though hooks are not
> meant to be called conditionally. This is because the `__DEV__` check can be
> considered constant in that it will always be true or false for the
> environment (development or production).

When a contributor would like to communicate a warning to a developer, they
should use the `warning()` helper.

```ts
warning(condition, 'This is the message that is logged when condition is truth-y')
```

This helper allows you to provide a `condition`. When the condition is truth-y
it will emit the message provided. This helper is automatically wrapped in a
`__DEV__` block and will be removed from production builds.

For more complex conditions, a contributor may combine `console.warn()` with
`__DEV__` when `warning()` does not suffice."
"## Context

There are several components in Primer React that make use of live regions.
However, the library does not have a central pattern for making accessible live
region announcements. This ADR documents the decision to use a central pattern
for live region announcements that can be used across Primer and GitHub.

ARIA Live regions fall into several buckets that we may want to use as component
authors:

- [ARIA live region roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#live_region_roles), such as `alert`, `log`, or `status`
- [The `aria-live` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-live) to turn an element into a live region

In components, we see the following scenarios in Primer React:

- Announce the contents of an element when it is rendered or on page load, like when a spinner is displayed or a form is submitted
- Announce the changes to the content of an element, like when the count inside of a
  button is incremented
- Announce a message programmatically, such as the number of results for a query

Currently, contributors may reach for roles such as `alert` or `status` to
achieve these scenarios. They may also add `aria-live=""assertive""` or `aria-live=""polite""` with an an `aria-atomic=""true""` to an element explicitly.
However, both of these approaches do not announce consistently across screen
readers. This could be due to live regions being injected dynamically into the document (this includes loading content into the document via React), dynamically changing the visibility of a live region, or some other technique causing an announcement to not be announced.

For more information about the ways in which live regions may not work as
expected, visit: [Why are my live regions not working?](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2024/05/01/why-are-my-live-regions-not-working/)","## Decision 
## Decision

We will create a `LiveRegion` component that can be used across Primer React to announce messages to screen readers. This component will be responsible for creating a live region that is consistently announced across screen readers. The `LiveRegion` component will be used in the following ways:

- To announce the contents of an element when it is rendered or on page load
- To announce the changes to the content of an element
- To announce a message programmatically

The `LiveRegion` component will use the `aria-live` attribute with a value of `polite` or `assertive` depending on the urgency of the message. The `aria-atomic` attribute will be set to `true` to ensure that the entire contents of the live region are announced. The `aria-relevant` attribute will be set to `additions text` to ensure that additions to the live region are announced.

The `LiveRegion` component will be implemented as a React context provider that can be used to announce messages from anywhere in the application. The context provider will be responsible for creating the live region and managing the announcements. The `LiveRegion` component will also provide a hook that can be used to announce messages from functional components.

The `LiveRegion` component will be documented in the Primer React documentation and will be included in the Primer React design system. The `LiveRegion` component will be used in all Primer React components that require live region announcements.","## Decision

In order to have a common interop point for live region announcements, Primer React will
make use of a `live-region` custom element from `@primer/live-region-element`.
This package will be included and published from the `primer/react` repo.

The custom element exposes a way to make announcements that can be used
across frameworks. This makes it useful not only for Primer but GitHub as a
whole. The `@primer/live-region-element` exports two helpers to use for making
announcements: `announce()` and `announceFromElement`. Both helpers can be used
when working in Primer and by teams at GitHub.

In addition, `@primer/react` will leverage and export the following helpers for
use within Primer React and GitHub:

- The `AriaStatus` component to correspond with `role=""status""`
- The `AriaAlert` component to correspond with `role=""alert""`

Within `@primer/react`, we should lint against usage of `aria-live` and the
corresponding roles (if possible) and suggest using these alternatives instead.

> [!NOTE]
> Both `AriaStatus` and `AriaAlert` will trigger an announcement when the component is
> rendered. As a result, they should only be used for dynamically rendered
> content. Otherwise, they will trigger announcements on page load. In cases
> where they should always be present, then the first message passed to the
> component should be an empty string. Changes to the content of the component
> will trigger subsequent announcements."
## Context,Please provide the context for which you'd like me to generate an architecture decision.,"## Decision

1. npm package: ""Experimental"" components, as defined by the component lifecycle, should not be part of semantically versioned npm package for `@primer/react`.

2. npm package: Each experimental component should be independently published and versioned with semver. Breaking changes should be tagged as major versions. Example: `@github/experimental-react-commentbox`

3. The code for experimental components should live in a new repository, example: [github/react-experimental](https://github.com/github/react-experimental) and published as individual packages as suggested in point 2.

This will help in sharing experimental components between the monolith and projects outside of monolith. The ownership and responsibility of maintenance will be shared by multiple teams (including primer)."
"## Context

Our testing infrastructure consists of Jest ""unit"" tests and automatic Chromatic visual testing. Both of these are super useful but we have been experiencing a few setbacks.
Unofficially we test more complex interactive scenarios using our storybooks setup.

1. Repeated markup in storybooks and jest tests - Since there is not automation of interaction in storybooks, we tend to test them out manually in stories and then transfer to jest. This results in us constructing similar test case scenarios in storybooks and in tests.

2. Debugging complex jest tests - There is no visual aspect to jest tests. Mostly everything is CLI based. This makes it hard to debug broken tests. Visibility into these tests is also low for people who want to enhance them.","## Decision 
## Decision

We decided to adopt Playwright for end-to-end testing to bridge the gap between Jest unit tests, Chromatic visual testing, and manual Storybook interactions. Playwright provides automated browser-based testing with support for rich interactions, visual assertions, and execution in real rendering environments.

By using Playwright:
- We eliminate markup duplication by reusing Storybook stories as test fixtures, loading them directly in the browser during E2E runs.
- Complex interactive scenarios previously tested manually in Storybooks are now automated and reliable.
- Debugging is improved through built-in tools like headful mode, browser developer tools, screenshots, videos, and trace recordings.
- Tests become more accessible to team members unfamiliar with Jest internals, as they can visually observe test behavior.

Playwright integrates into our CI pipeline alongside Jest and Chromatic, running critical user workflows to ensure functional and visual correctness across layers. This creates a more cohesive, maintainable, and observable testing strategy.","## Decisions

Going forward, we can use [storybook's play functions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function) to write interaction tests for our components. Here's a document that describes [how to add and run these tests](../storybook-tests.md).
Guidelines to make this easier -

1. Create a new storybook file for your components and call them ""interactions"". Inside these files, we can import the stories from ""examples"" or ""fixtures"" and tack on play functions to them. This will create duplicate stories but with the added benefit of the tests appearing in the interactions add-on tab. This tab will let you step through your tests step by step, increasing visibility and debuggability.

2. Port complex jest tests onto interactive tests. This is up to developer discretion. My recommendation is to have basic ""unit"" tests like component existence and axe tests in jest. Anything that can benefit from a visual aspect to it can be moved to interaction tests.

3. Interaction tests are not perfect. Some aspects like mocking can be challenging and we will find solutions to these as when the need arises."

> tl;dr
>
> We have workspaces within the project but no official way of connecting them or managing dependencies from the top-level. Similarly, scripts that grow in size or complexity have no dedicated home or ability to manage dependencies outside of the top-level workspace.

The `primer/react` repo is composed of several workspaces that use `npm` to manage dependencies. In order to install these dependencies, a contributor needs to visit each directory and run `npm install`. The project also has a convenience script for this task, invoked through `npm run setup`, that goes through this process for contributors.

These distinct workspaces may sometimes depend on each other. For example, the `docs` workspace depends on the `@primer/react` package which is defined at the top-level of the project. Similarly, examples in the `examples/*` folders may also depend on `@primer/react`. Currently these dependencies are expressed either through relative paths, file dependencies in `package.json`, or symlinks through `npm link`.

There is also a collection of scripts under the `script` directory that exist in the project that involve varying levels of complexity and depth.","## Decision 
## Decision

Adopt a monorepo tool to manage workspaces, dependencies, and scripts holistically. Use `pnpm` with its built-in workspace support to unify dependency management across all packages.

Key decisions:
- Replace individual `npm install` calls in each workspace with a single, top-level `pnpm install` that manages all dependencies across workspaces.
- Define inter-package dependencies using version ranges (e.g., `workspace:*`) so that local packages are automatically linked during development and resolved correctly in CI/publishing.
- Migrate all existing workspaces to be part of the `pnpm` workspace configuration via `packages` field in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- Move and modularize scripts under the `scripts/` directory into standalone workspace(s), such as `@primer/scripts`, allowing them to have their own dependencies and executable binaries.
- Update the `setup` script to run `pnpm install` at the root, ensuring consistent and reproducible installations.

This approach eliminates manual linking, simplifies onboarding, ensures consistent dependency resolution, and provides a scalable structure for growing tooling. Additionally, `pnpm`’s high performance and symlink-free linking make it well-suited for our monorepo needs.","## Decision

Setup the project to use [`npm` workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces). This will require changing the project to have a top-level `package.json` file which will use `workspaces` to reference child workspaces. The layout for the project would then be:

```
- root
  # Root package.json, defines workspaces
  - package.json

  # Workspaces
  - docs
  - packages
    - react
    - *
  - examples
    - nextjs
    - consumer-test
    - *

  # Top-level scripts
  - script

  # Testing & Development
  - .storybook
  - .playwright

  # Repo config
  - .github
  - .vscode
```

The following items will be installed and ran at the root-level:

- Linting
  - `eslint`
  - `markdownlint`
- Testing
  - Jest
  - Playwright
- Development
  - Storybook
- Type checking
  - TypeScript

Certain configuration items, like for TypeScript or Babel, may need configuration defined at the top-level and extended by child workspaces.

The current `@primer/react` package will move to the `packages/react` package. Workspaces that depend on `@primer/react` should reference the version of that package."
"## Context

Currently all files live under the `src` directory. In the `npm` package for `@primer/react`, we specify the following export pattern:

```json5
{
  exports: {
    // ...
    './lib-esm/*': {
      import: [
        // ...
      ],
      require: [
        // ...
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

This pattern, along with our Rollup setup, opts-in files and folders under the `src` directory into the public API of the package. This means that certain parts of the codebase which aren't intended to be used outside of `@primer/react` are considered part of its public API and can be imported and used by consumers.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will restructure the source code to separate internal and public modules by introducing a `src/internal` directory for files that are not intended to be part of the public API.

Additionally, we will update the `exports` field in `package.json` to explicitly control public entry points, restricting access to `src/internal` and any other non-public paths. This ensures only explicitly exported modules under `lib-esm/*` can be imported by consumers, preventing unintended usage of internal implementation details.","## Decision

Adopt a convention in Primer React where internal modules live in the `src/internal` folder. This folder which would include all components, hooks, and other modules which are not intended for usage outside of the project. Files within `src/internal` may be grouped by area, such as `src/internal/components`, `src/internal/hooks`, etc.

In the `""exports""` field of our `npm` package, we can then add the following pattern:

```json5
{
  exports: {
    // ...
    './lib-esm/internal/*': null,
  },
}
```

This pattern would remove any files and folders within `src/internal` from the public API of the `npm` package. This pattern is inspired by [this section](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#package-entry-points) from Node.js, specifically this example:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""my-package"",
  ""exports"": {
    ""."": ""./lib/index.js"",
    ""./feature/*.js"": ""./feature/*.js"",
    ""./feature/internal/*"": null
  }
}
```"

Reasons for change: Performance, utilise css variables

The main reason for changing our styling architecture is to remove performance issues for applications:

Relevant parts from [primer/discussions#1928](https://github.com/github/primer/discussions/1928#reasons)(Hubbers only link):

1. Initial page loads take longer

   Because styles are injected during runtime, we can not parallelize this work. The page is un-styled till the javascript bundle is
   downloaded and processed. The processing time is longer on slower devices.

   Benchmarks:

   i. Lab benchmarks: rendering a page with 1000 components
   runtime injection of css: 242ms
   static .css files: 96ms (60% faster)

   ii. Application benchmarks: render times for repo directory (>1000 files, [gh/gh#241090](https://github.com/github/github/pull/241090))
   with primer/react Box: 3800ms
   with custom css: 3076ms (20% faster)

2. Slow server side rendering

   Some applications are able to make up for slower initial render times by collecting styles on the server first. In the correct stack, collecting styles requires rendering the app twice before we can ship any html to the user.

   benchmarks: in the issues-app experiment, collecting styles on the server contributed to + 20% of rendering time (450ms on top of 1900ms)

3. Style updates are expensive

   The slowest part of the current stack is updating styles based on props or state. Big changes take linearly longer, worse on slower devices.

   Benchmarks:

   i. Lab benchmarks: updating a page with 1000 components, static runtime css vs. dynamic runtime css (thanks @mattcosta7 for these!)

   re-rendering components with fixed styles on runtime: 242ms
   re-rendering components with dynamic styles on runtime: 441ms (55% slower)

   ii. Application benchmarks: opting out of IconButton for PR diff view (>500 files, [gh/gh#243269](https://github.com/github/github/pull/243269))

   dynamic styles with sx prop: 400ms
   dynamic styles with .css files: 165ms (60% faster)

The other reasons for change are to utilise css variables for theming and improve the guardrails of consuming primer/primitives","## Decision  
## Decision

Migrate from runtime style injection (e.g., `@primer/react`'s `sx` prop) to static CSS files using CSS Custom Properties (CSS variables) for styling.

### Key Decisions:

- **Adopt static `.css` or `.css.ts` files** for component styles to enable:
  - Parallel downloading of CSS and JavaScript.
  - Faster initial render by eliminating the need to inject styles at runtime.
  - Improved server-side rendering performance by removing double-rendering requirements for style collection.

- **Use CSS Custom Properties (variables)** to support dynamic theming capabilities previously provided by the `sx` prop, enabling:
  - Runtime theme switching without re-rendering.
  - Consistent and scalable theming across applications.
  - Better alignment with Primer Primitives and design tokens.

- **Define strict style composition patterns** to improve developer guardrails and prevent unsafe overrides, including:
  - Discouraging unrestricted inline styles or ad-hoc `sx` usage.
  - Encouraging use of predefined utility classes and token-driven values.

- **Update build tooling** to support:
  - Extraction and bundling of static CSS.
  - Inclusion of CSS variables in design system deliverables.
  - Tree-shaking unused styles where possible.

This shift improves runtime performance, reduces JavaScript overhead, accelerates page loads, and maintains flexibility for theming and customization — aligning with modern best practices for scalable, high-performance web applications.","## Decisions

1. Manually refactor styles to css files + css modules

   Use css variables from primer/primitives for inexpensive theming support, especially with server side rendering

2. Use css modules with hash

   By importing styles in the component, we can create an explicit dependency between the two. This enables applications using primer to have control over bundling and delivery.

   To begin with, we will ship a single css bundle that can be imported in the application. (example: `import '@primer/react/styles.css'`). When needed, we have the option to delegate bundling of css files to the application (they can be split by page or bundled as a common chunk for all react pages to share)

3. Keep styled-components underneath for supporting sx prop.

   Keep backward compatibility, we might change this in the future

Code example:

```jsx
import clsx from 'clsx'
import classNames from './ActionList.module.css'

const Button = ({className, sx, ...props}}) => {
  return (
    <Box
      as=""button""
      sx={sx}
      // it's important to pass both internal and props.className to the element
      className={clsx(classNames.ActionList, className)}
      {...props}
    >
    </Box>
  )
}
```"

> **Note**
> This ADR supercedes [`ADR 009`](./adr-009-interaction-tests.md)

We author tests using a combination of Jest and Playwright. Typically, Jest is
used for unit and integration tests and Playwright is used for Visual Regression
Tests against our Storybook.

In `ADR 009`, we proposed using Storybook's [`play`
functions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function) as
the recommended way to author tests that require tests based on user
interactions. In this ADR, we would like to revisit this decision.","## Decision 
## Decision

We decided to deprecate the use of Storybook's `play` functions for interaction tests and instead adopt Playwright as the standard for all user interaction testing. Interaction tests should be written as standalone Playwright test files colocated with relevant component stories or in a dedicated `tests/interaction` directory. This shift ensures better test maintainability, clearer debugging, improved CI integration, and separation of concerns between documentation (Storybook) and testing (Playwright).","## Decision

For tests involving interaction, use Playwright to visit a storybook story and
interact with the component directly. This will allow for easy integration with
Visual Regression Testing and our automated accessibility testing (through axe).
In order to perform interactions, use [actions from
Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/input)."
"## Context

There are situations where a component prop can support a value or a ""responsive
value"" that results in the value changing depending on the viewport size. For
example:

```tsx
// Value
<Stack gap=""condensed"" />

// Responsive value
<Stack gap={{ narrow: 'condensed', regular: 'normal', wide: 'spacious' />
```

Typically, a responsive value will support all of our named breakpoints: narrow,
regular, and wide. Authors can use a hook called `useResponsiveValue` to support
resolving the value of a prop based on the current viewport size. The
implementation of this hook uses [`matchMedia`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia)
which, unfortunately, has a downside: the value of a prop may shift when the
component is server-side rendered. If the prop is used for styles or layout, then this will lead to a layout shift
when the component hydrates and the viewport size is different than the fallback
size on the server.

As a result, we would like to offer a paved path for providing responsive props
in a way tha twill not lead to layout shift during server-side rendering.","## Decision 
## Decision
We will standardize the use of **CSS-based responsive props** instead of JavaScript `matchMedia` for handling responsive values in components. This means that responsive prop values (e.g., `gap`, `direction`, `padding`) will be translated into CSS classes or custom properties scoped to media queries defined at the stylesheet level.

Instead of resolving the active value during runtime via `useResponsiveValue`, the component will apply a class or style attribute that references responsive CSS variables or utility classes, which are evaluated by the browser according to viewport size.

For example:

```tsx
<Stack gap={{ narrow: 'condensed', regular: 'normal', wide: 'spacious' }} />
```

will output a consistent class structure server-side and rely on client-side CSS rules to apply the correct spacing per breakpoint:

```css
.stack--gap-responsive {
  --stack-gap: var(--gap-condensed);
}

@media (min-width: $breakpoint-regular) {
  .stack--gap-responsive {
    --stack-gap: var(--gap-normal);
  }
}

@media (min-width: $breakpoint-wide) {
  .stack--gap-responsive {
    --stack-gap: var(--gap-spacious);
  }
}
```

This approach eliminates layout shifts during hydration because:
- The server does not need to guess the viewport size.
- No JavaScript is required to determine the initial value.
- Layout-defining styles are stable and resolved consistently by the browser.

The `useResponsiveValue` hook will be deprecated for layout-affecting props and only used for non-layout purposes (e.g., conditional rendering, analytics) where shifts are acceptable.

A set of utility mixins and design token mappings will be provided to ensure type safety and consistency across components.","## Decision

Authors should use data attributes to bridge between responsive values in
JavaScript and the corresponding styles in CSS. Authors should avoid using
JavaScript-driven mechanisms for controlling responsive values in order to
prevent layout shift during SSR.

For example, consider a `Stack` component that has a `gap` prop. This prop can
receive a plain value or one that is a responsive value. To support this,
authors should use the following patterns:

```tsx
type GapScale = 'none' | 'condensed' | 'normal' | 'spacious'

type StackProps = React.PropsWithChildren<{
  // Responsive props should be a union of the value of the prop plus
  // `ResponsiveValue` over that value
  gap?: GapScale | ResponsiveValue<GapScale>
}>

function Stack({children, gap}: StackProps) {
  // The `getResponsiveAttributes` helper is useful for adding the corresponding
  // `data-*` attributes to the container for the compnoent.
  //
  // In this case, it will add `data-gap` and `data-gap-{breakpoint}` attributes
  // with the corresponding value set
  return <StyledStack {...getResponsiveAttributes('gap', gap)}>{children}</StyledStack>
}

const StyledStack = styled.div`
  &[data-gap='none'],
  &[data-gap-narrow='none'] {
    /* ... */
  }

  &[data-gap='condensed'],
  &[data-gap-narrow='condensed'] {
    /* ... */
  }

  /* ... */

  // @custom-media --viewportRange-regular
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    &[data-gap-regular='none'] {
      /* ... */
    }

    &[data-gap-regular='condensed'] {
      /* ... */
    }

    /* ... */
  }

  // @custom-media --viewportRange-wide
  @media (min-width: 1400px) {
    &[data-gap-wide='none'] {
      /* ... */
    }

    &[data-gap-wide='condensed'] {
      /* ... */
    }

    /* ... */
  }
`
```

By default, this approach uses the following conventions:

- Props which may have responsive values should have a value that is
  serializable, ideally as a `string` or `boolean`
- Props will be provided on the component as a data attribute, using the format:
  `data-{propName}`
- For responsive values, the breakpoint name will be appended to the data
  attribute name specified above. For example: `data-{propName}-{breakpoint}`

Data attributes will act as a bridge between JavaScript and CSS. In CSS, authors
should use these data attributes to apply styles based on the value of the
attribute per-breakpoint.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a utility named `getResponsiveAttributes` that can be used to generate
> the corresponding `data-*` attributes for the props which may have responsive
> values."
"## Context

There are times when a prop is deprecated in favor of a more accessible API or a more flexible prop that can support a wider range of values. In these cases, we want to provide a clear path for authors to migrate from the deprecated prop to the new API.

For
example:

```tsx
// old API
<ActionList>
  <ActionList.Group title=""Group title"">
    <ActionList.Item>Item 1</ActionList.Item>
    <ActionList.Item>Item 2</ActionList.Item>
  </ActionList.Group>
</ActionList>
```

```tsx
// new API
<ActionList>
  <ActionList.Group>
    <ActionList.GroupHeading as=""h2"">Group title</ActionList.GroupHeading>
    <ActionList.Item>Item 1</ActionList.Item>
    <ActionList.Item>Item 2</ActionList.Item>
  </ActionList.Group>
</ActionList>
```","## Decision  
## Decision

We will deprecate the `title` prop in `ActionList.Group` in favor of the new, more accessible and semantically correct `ActionList.GroupHeading` component. This change allows authors to:

- Control the heading level via the `as` prop (e.g., `h2`, `h3`), improving document structure and accessibility.
- Use richer content within group headings if needed (e.g., icons, emphasis).
- Align with modern UI component design principles that separate structure from content.

### Migration Path
1. **Deprecation**: The `title` prop is marked as deprecated in TypeScript and documented as such in the component API.
2. **Warning**: A runtime warning is logged in development mode when the `title` prop is used, directing developers to use `ActionList.GroupHeading`.
3. **Documentation**: The docs are updated to showcase the new pattern as the recommended approach, with a clear deprecation notice for the old API.
4. **Removal**: The `title` prop will be removed in the next major version.

### Example Update
```tsx
// Before
<ActionList.Group title=""Group title"">
  <ActionList.Item>Item 1</ActionList.Item>
</ActionList.Group>

// After
<ActionList.Group>
  <ActionList.GroupHeading as=""h2"">Group title</ActionList.GroupHeading>
  <ActionList.Item>Item 1</ActionList.Item>
</ActionList.Group>
```

This change supports better accessibility, flexibility, and semantic markup while providing a smooth migration path.","## Decision

1. Add the `@deprecated` TS notice, if possible, to the corresponding type
2. Mark the prop as deprecated in the component's documentation
3. Add an eslint rule or extend an existing one to warn against using the deprecated prop
4. Update the `primer/react` eslint plugin at github/github and evaluate the impact of the deprecation
5. If the change is minimal and safe, proceed with the auto fix of the eslint rule and create PRs by codeowners
6. If the change is large, add an eslint disable to each instance of the deprecated prop at github/github and make sure they show up on the accessibility score cards so that we can track the usage of the deprecated prop
7. Enable the eslint rule afterwards in github/github so that the new instances of the deprecated prop are heavily discouraged"

- While there is not a standard convention, many applications support setting proxies via the environment variables `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `no_proxy`, such as curl, wget, perl, python, docker, git, and R
  - Some of these applications use `HTTPS_PROXY` versus `https_proxy`, but most understand or primarily support the lowercase variant","## Decision 
## Decision

We will support proxy configuration through the standard environment variables `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` using lowercase names. This aligns with common industry practice observed in tools such as curl, wget, git, Docker, and others. The proxy settings will be automatically detected and applied when making outbound HTTP/HTTPS requests from self-hosted runners.

Support for uppercase variants (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`) will also be implemented for backward compatibility and broader interoperability, but documentation will emphasize the lowercase forms as canonical. The `no_proxy` variable will support comma-separated hostnames, IP addresses, and domain suffixes to bypass the proxy where needed.

This approach ensures seamless integration into enterprise environments with existing proxy infrastructure without requiring additional configuration beyond standard environment setup.","## Decision

We will update the Runner to use the conventional environment variables for proxies: `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` if they are set.
These are described in detail below:
- `https_proxy` a proxy URL for all https traffic. It may contain basic authentication credentials. For example:
  - http://proxy.com
  - http://127.0.0.1:8080
  - http://user:password@proxy.com
- `http_proxy` a proxy URL for all http traffic. It may contain basic authentication credentials. For example:
  - http://proxy.com
  - http://127.0.0.1:8080
  - http://user:password@proxy.com
- `no_proxy` a comma-separated list of hosts that should not use the proxy. An optional port may be specified. For example:
  - `google.com`
  - `yahoo.com:443`
  - `google.com,bing.com`

We won't use `http_proxy` for https traffic when `https_proxy` is not set, this behavior lines up with any libcurl based tools (curl, git) and wget.
Otherwise, action authors and workflow users need to adjust to differences between the runner proxy convention, and tools used by their actions and scripts.  

Example:  
  Customer sets `http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888` and configures the runner against `https://github.com/owner/repo`, with the `https_proxy` -> `http_proxy` fallback, the runner will connect to the server without any problem. However, if a user runs `git push` to `https://github.com/owner/repo`, `git` won't use the proxy since it requires `https_proxy` to be set for any https traffic.

> `golang`, `node.js`, and other dev tools from the Linux community use `http_proxy` for both http and https traffic based on my research.

A majority of our users are using Linux where these variables are commonly required to be set by various programs. By reading these values, we simplify the process for self-hosted runners to set up a proxy and expose it in a way users are already familiar with.

A password provided for a proxy will be masked in the logs.

We will support the lowercase and uppercase variants, with lowercase taking priority if both are set."
"## Context

Command echoing as a default behavior tends to clutter the user logs, so we want to swap to a system where users have to opt in to see this information.

Command outputs will still be echoed in the case there are any errors processing such commands. This is so the end user can have more context on why the command failed and help with troubleshooting.

Echo output in the user logs can be explicitly controlled by the new commands `::echo::on` and `::echo::off`. By default, echoing is enabled if `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret is enabled, otherwise echoing is disabled.","## Decision 
## Decision

Change the default command echoing behavior to be disabled unless explicitly enabled.

Echoing of commands in logs will now follow this logic:
- By default, command echoing is **disabled** to reduce log clutter.
- Echoing is automatically **enabled** if the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret is set, allowing maintainers or advanced users to opt into verbose output.
- Users can explicitly control echoing within a workflow using the `::echo::on` and `::echo::off` commands for fine-grained control.
- Command echoing is **automatically re-enabled** when a command fails, ensuring error context is visible for debugging purposes.

This change improves log readability while preserving diagnostic capability when needed.","## Decision
- The only commands that currently echo output are
  - `remove-matcher`
  - `add-matcher`
  - `add-path`
- These will no longer echo the command, if processed successfully
- All commands echo the input when any of these conditions is fulfilled:
  1. When such commands fail with an error
  2. When `::echo::on` is set
  3. When the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` is set, and echoing hasn't been explicitly disabled with `::echo::off`
- There are a few commands that won't be echoed, even when echo is enabled. These are (as of 2019/11/04):
   - `add-mask`
   - `debug`
   - `warning`
   - `error`
- The three commands above will not echo, either because echoing the command would leak secrets (e.g. `add-mask`), or it would not add any additional troubleshooting information to the logs (e.g. `debug`). It's expected that future commands would follow these ""echo-suppressing"" guidelines as well. Echo-suppressed commands are still free to output other information to the logs, as deemed fit."
"## Context

- Provide a mechanism in the runner to include extra information in `Set up job` step's log.
  Ex: Include OS/Software info from Hosted image.","## Decision 
## Decision

Add support for emitting diagnostic environment metadata at the start of the `Set up job` step in the runner.

The runner will collect predefined environment variables (e.g., OS version, installed software versions) from the hosted image and log them in a structured, collapsible section within the `Set up job` step output. This data will be presented under a header such as ""Environment Information"" to improve transparency and aid debugging.

This approach ensures visibility without requiring user scripts to manually log environment details, integrates seamlessly into existing workflows, and maintains consistency across jobs.","## Decision

The runner will look for a file `.setup_info` under the runner's root directory, The file can be a JSON with a simple schema.
```json
[
  {
    ""group"": ""OS Detail"",
    ""detail"": ""........""
  },
  {
    ""group"": ""Software Detail"",
    ""detail"": ""........""
  }
]
```
The runner will use `::group` and `::endgroup` to fold all detail info into an expandable group.

Both [virtual-environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) and self-hosted runners can use this mechanism to add extra logging info to the `Set up job` step's log."

This ADR proposes adding `steps.<id>.outcome` and `steps.<id>.conclusion` to the steps context.

This allows downstream a step to run based on whether a previous step succeeded or failed.

Reminder, currently the steps contains `steps.<id>.outputs`.","## Decision  
## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: ""Add `steps.<id>.outcome` and `steps.<id>.conclusion` to the steps context"", because

- It enables conditional execution of downstream steps based on the success or failure of prior steps
- It improves workflow flexibility and error handling without requiring external scripting
- It aligns with common CI/CD patterns where step outcomes drive subsequent actions
- Users can implement fallbacks, cleanup routines, or notifications based on step results
- The addition is backward-compatible and does not break existing configurations

This enhancement makes workflows more expressive while maintaining simplicity and readability.","## Decision

For steps that have completed, populate `steps.<id>.outcome` and `steps.<id>.conclusion` with one of the following values:

- `success`
- `failure`
- `cancelled`
- `skipped`

When a continue-on-error step fails, the outcome will be `failure` even though the final conclusion is `success`."
"## Context

Since configuring self-hosted runners is commonly automated via scripts, the labels need to be able to be created during configuration.  The runner currently registers the built-in labels (os, arch) during registration but does not accept labels via command line args to extend the set registered.

This is another version of [ADR275](https://github.com/actions/runner/pull/275)","## Decision 
## Decision Outcome

Modify the runner registration process to accept custom labels via command-line arguments. This allows automated configuration scripts to define additional labels during setup, enabling better job routing and resource management in self-hosted environments.

This change aligns with common infrastructure-as-code practices and supports dynamic labeling without requiring post-registration modifications. The built-in labels (os, arch) will continue to be registered automatically, while user-defined labels will be added as specified during registration.","## Decision

This ADR proposes that we add a `--labels` option to the `config`, which could be used to add custom additional labels to the configured runner.

For example, to add a single additional label the operator could run:
```bash
./config.sh --labels mylabel
```
> Note: the current runner command line parsing and envvar override algorithm only support a single argument (key).

This would add the label `mylabel` to the runner, and enable users to select the runner in their workflow using this label:
```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, mylabel]
```

To add multiple labels the operator could run:
```bash
./config.sh --labels mylabel,anotherlabel
```
> Note: the current runner command line parsing and envvar override algorithm only supports a single argument (key).

This would add the label `mylabel` and `anotherlabel` to the runner, and enable users to select the runner in their workflow using this label:
```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, mylabel, anotherlabel]
```

It would not be possible to remove labels from an existing runner using `config.sh`, instead labels would have to be removed using the GitHub UI.

The labels argument will split on commas, trim and discard empty strings.  That effectively means don't use commas in unattended config label names.  Alternatively, we could choose to escape commas but it's a nice to have."
"## Context
SS?? fundamentally relies on a third-party provider service to authenticate requests (e.g. OAuth2
via Google). The provider may experience transient faults for any number of reasons - perhaps the
provider is experiencing a transient outage, or our traffic has been temporarily rate limited. We
wanted to build SS?? to anticipate and handle the presence of faults during communication with
authentication providers, no matter the underlying cause.","## Decision  
## Decision

We will implement a resilient authentication layer that gracefully handles transient faults when communicating with third-party identity providers. This includes:

* Introducing configurable retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for failed authentication requests.
* Wrapping external provider calls in a fault-tolerant abstraction (e.g., a dedicated auth client with built-in circuit breaker patterns).
* Ensuring authentication failures are logged meaningfully without exposing sensitive information.
* Returning user-friendly error messages to the client while preserving security guarantees.

This approach ensures that temporary outages or rate limiting on the provider side do not result in complete authentication failure, improving system reliability and user experience.","## Decision
We implemented a generic `circuit.Breaker` type, which implements the ""Circuit Breaker"" design
pattern made popular by Michael T. Nygard's book, [""Release It!""](
https://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it). All requests to the provider service are issued through
a stateful `circuit.Breaker` instance, which tracks the frequency of request failures. When the
`Breaker` sees that enough requests are failing, it temporarily suspends all outgoing traffic to the
provider (i.e. ""enters `Open` state). After some time, the `Breaker` transitions to a `HalfOpen`
state, in which a limited number of outbound requests are allowed. If failures persist, then the
`Breaker` will once again suspend outbound traffic, re-enter `Open` state, and typically will wait
for a longer interval of time before trying again. If instead the `Breaker` observes that requests
are consistently succeeding, then it will resume all outbound traffic (i.e. enter `Closed` state).

The SS?? [`docs`](/docs/) directory contains a [Circuit Breaker](
/docs/architecture/circuit-breaker.md) document with more details. The implementation can be found

"## Context

Extensions are defined by an EDN file accessed from decentralized storage. An URI schema allows to identify those files.","## Decision 
## Decision

The URI schema for extensions MUST follow the format: `extension://<namespace>/<name>`, where:

- `<namespace>` identifies the organization, project, or domain that owns the extension,
- `<name>` is the unique identifier of the extension within that namespace.

The EDN file located at the resolved decentralized storage address MUST contain:
- A `spec-version` field indicating compatibility with the extension system,
- A `dependencies` section listing any required extensions or runtime versions,
- A `handlers` map defining entrypoints for execution,
- A `metadata` section including human-readable name, description, and version.

Resolution of the URI is performed by:
1. Mapping the `extension://` scheme to a configured decentralized storage gateway (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave),
2. Resolving `<namespace>/<name>` to a content ID (CID) via a registry contract or DNS-based lookup,
3. Fetching and validating the EDN file from the decentralized network.

Caching of resolved URIs and their contents is RECOMMENDED to improve performance and reduce network load.","## Decision

We want to launch our beta in Q2. This requires us to keep a tight scope and stay on the critical path.

Group chat is not as vital as 1-1 chat for the chat experience. It is also
likely not as useful for an MVP as public chat is, since this gives people a
chance to talk to strangers and it is open by default.

Whether group chats are in scope or not has been a recurring discussing and a
lot of effort has been wasted related to this.

There are currently a lot of outstanding regressions related to group chat: https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/labels/group-chat Additionally, since group chats are private the encryption and security of those are generally harder than 1-1 and public chat.","## Decision

Currently peers for messaging are hardcoded in the app. This means we can't
easily scale, as some of these nodes might fill up when we have more than N
active users.

Discovery v5 protocol (https://ideas.status.im/ideas/092-disc-v5-research,
https://github.com/fjl/p2p-drafts/blob/master/discv5-eip.md) allow us to
discover new peers from the app and scale server peers in our cluster
independently. This is vital for high availability/reliability and security.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will implement Discovery v5 protocol to enable dynamic peer discovery and improve scalability, reliability, and security of our messaging infrastructure.

Hardcoded peer configurations are not sustainable for growing user bases and introduce single points of failure. By adopting Discovery v5, we allow clients to dynamically discover available and healthy peers in the network without requiring configuration changes or app updates.

Key benefits include:

- **Scalability**: Server peers can be added or removed independently of client deployments.
- **High Availability**: Clients can automatically discover alternative peers if some nodes become unreachable.
- **Decentralized Operations**: Reduces dependency on centralized peer lists, aligning with decentralized architecture principles.
- **Security**: Supports encrypted handshake and topic-based node discovery, improving resistance to spoofing and eavesdropping.

Implementation steps:
1. Integrate Discovery v5 library (e.g., `discv5` in Go or equivalent).
2. Configure bootstrap nodes to seed initial network connectivity.
3. Set up topic-based discovery for specific services or regions if needed.
4. Deprecate hardcoded peer lists and migrate existing peers into the discoverable network.
5. Monitor peer health and discovery performance via observability tools.

This decision aligns with long-term goals of building a resilient, scalable, and maintainable peer-to-peer messaging system.","## Decision

- Use and enable Discovery v5 for all networks
- Do this before beta is released

This means we have capacity to achieve 5000+ DAU / 500 concurrent connection. It
seems unlikely we can do so with reliable messaging in the current setup.

Trade-off for this is:
- Uncertainty in introducing a new protocol leading to possible delays
- Possible increase in CPU/Network (we can disable protocol once peers are found though)"

Idea [142-Wallet-Compatibility](https://ideas.status.im/ideas/142-wallet-compatibility/README) changes the way we generate keys starting from the 12 mnemonic words.

This change allows users to create a wallet in other apps and import the same address in Status using the 12 mnemonic words.","## Decision 
## Decision

We adopt BIP-39 (mnemonic phrase) and BIP-44 (multi-account hierarchy) standards for key derivation in Status Wallet to ensure cross-wallet compatibility.

This decision aligns with the broader ecosystem by using industry-standard deterministic key generation, enabling users to recover their Status wallet accounts in other compliant wallets (e.g., Ledger, MetaMask, Trust Wallet) using the same 12-word mnemonic seed, and vice versa.

Key changes include:

- **Mnemonic Generation**: Use BIP-39 to generate a cryptographically secure 12-word mnemonic from entropy.
- **Key Derivation**: Use BIP-44 derivation path `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0` for Ethereum-compatible accounts (adjustable per coin type as needed).
- **Wallet Import/Export**: Support importing and exporting wallets via the 12-word mnemonic, ensuring interoperability.
- **User Experience**: Maintain a simple onboarding flow where users back up their mnemonic during wallet creation.

Backward compatibility will be preserved by allowing existing account types to continue functioning, while new wallets default to the BIP-39/BIP-44 standard.

Security considerations:
- Users are educated on the critical importance of securing their mnemonic.
- No plaintext storage of mnemonics in app state; encrypted storage only where necessary.
- Warnings are displayed during backup and restore flows.

This change significantly improves user experience and trust by eliminating vendor lock-in and adhering to widely reviewed and adopted standards.","## Decision

* update the BIP39 seed generation to use the salt `""mnemonic""` instead of `""status-im""` following [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki#from-mnemonic-to-seed).

* update the master key generation using the constant `""Bitcoin seed""` instead of `""status-im""`, following [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki#master-key-generation).

* remove the use of the password in the salt during the BIP39 seed generation (password is not removed from the app in general, and it's still required to encrypt the keys on the device)."
"## Context

On the path to releasing a usable beta we've faced a variety of performance
issues:

- https://github.com/status-im/ideas/issues/55
- https://ideas.status.im/ideas/071-low-traffic
- https://ideas.status.im/ideas/076-smooth-ui
- https://ideas.status.im/ideas/083-energy-efficient

Some of these performance issues are related to the use of LES, especially on
Mainnet. Examples of problems include: slow/hot sync, disk filling up, bandwidth
usage, etc. This can partly be remedied by the use of CHT to speed up sync
(https://github.com/status-im/status-go/wiki/Updating-CHT-BloomTrie).

In order to simplify the problem, we decided earlier this year to not spend too
much time looking into performance improvements related to LES, instead focusing
our efforts on improving the performance on Whisper and in client-side code.

This also means we don't have a full picture of to what extent LES is a
performance bottleneck for the Status app. It is possible proper use of CHT,
slowing sync down, vary load depending on if you are on WiFi or not, etc, can
solve these problems. However, the consensus right now is that ULC is the more
promising route to take.

However, since ULC isn't ready yet, this means we are relying on Infura. This
is a bad idea from a decentralization and security point of view. This can be
partly remedied by allowing the user to run an upstream node. It is still a bad
trust model, relying on third-party Ethereum nodes, and we want to get away
from this as soon as possible.

With ULC it is possible to connect to more than one node, which increases
decentralization and security.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will proceed with the development and integration of Ultra-Light Client (ULC) as the primary path forward for improving Ethereum node performance and reducing reliance on centralized infrastructure like Infura.

Given the known limitations of LES—particularly its impact on sync speed, disk usage, bandwidth consumption, and overall device performance—and the current lack of a comprehensive performance optimization strategy for LES in resource-constrained environments, ULC presents a more sustainable and secure alternative.

ULC enables trust-minimized connectivity to multiple upstream nodes, improving both decentralization and resilience compared to relying on a single third-party node. While ULC is not yet production-ready, we will prioritize its completion and testing to enable a beta release that maintains acceptable performance without compromising core decentralized principles.

In the interim, we will continue using Infura with the option for users to configure a custom upstream node, but this will be treated as a temporary mitigation. No significant engineering effort will be invested in optimizing LES beyond critical bug fixes or minimal CHT-related improvements that are low-risk and easy to maintain.

The focus of performance work will remain on client-side optimizations and Whisper improvements, while laying the groundwork for a full transition to ULC upon its readiness.","## Decision

1. Rely on upstream nodes for beta. For the closed beta scheduled to be releases
Q2 we will provide two ways of accessing the Ethereum network:

- Upstream RPC with Infura (default)
- Custom upstream node (https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/3994)

From a decentralization point of view we need the latter before we can release
the beta.

2. ULC MVP. Additionally, as soon as beta is released, assess and start to
   introduce ULC as an experimental non-default mode in the app.
   
By doing this we also support the network, since it is still a very new
protocol. ULC requires trusted peers to operate, and right now trust is
established by config (list of trusted peers).

Initially we could hardcode these nodes, with option to add your own. Later on
we can have some form of distributed directory with a rating system. This also
likely requires merging ULC upstream, so we aren't the only ones running trusted
nodes.

3. LES track (optional). If we still have resources and there's interest,
optionally run a parallel track to clean up LES usage (update CHT, cluster) and
understand exact performance impact and viablity of running LES on
resource-constrained devices.

These three decisions balances the following trade-offs:

- get a usable beta released as soon as possible
- provide users with options to get minimal amount of decentralization
- pave the way for trustless usage by default (ULC/LES node)"
"## Context

We have some data that we don't want to appear in the logs (user passwords are
a good example). Currently, they are passed around as strings, that could be
printed out by mistake in a log entry (see https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/issues/4053)","## Decision 
## Decision

We introduce a new type `Secp256k1` to represent private keys and sensitive data such as passwords. This type ensures that sensitive values are not accidentally logged or exposed in plaintext by overriding the default string representation.

The `Secp256k1` type (or an equivalent `SecretString`/`RedactedString` type, depending on context) should:

- Wrap the sensitive string value.
- Implement interfaces such as `fmt.Stringer` to return a redacted placeholder (e.g., `""<redacted>""`) when converted to a string.
- Provide controlled methods (e.g., `.Expose()`) for accessing the underlying value only in secure, intentional contexts.
- Be used consistently across the codebase for all sensitive inputs like passwords, mnemonics, and private keys.

This prevents accidental leakage via logs, error messages, or debug output while maintaining usability where the actual value is required (e.g., during cryptographic operations).","## Decision

To minimize the risk of leaking passwords through logs, we should not pass
passwords as strings in our codebase. We introduced a new type `MaskedData` in
`status-im.utils.security`.
update (16-Dec-2022) `status-im.utils.security` is now moved over to `utils.security.core` 

We use `(security/mask-data <data to hide>` to wrap sensitive data into this
type and then use `(security/unmask <masked-data>)` to get the plaintext back.

It is important to keep that sensitive data masked as much as possible, until
you need the plaintext to pass to the extenral APIs.

Example:
```clojure
(println (security/mask-data ""my-plaintext-password"")) ;; Outputs ""******""
(println (security/unmask (security/mask-data ""my-plaintext-password""))) ;; Outputs ""my-plaintext-password""
```"
"## Context

Originally, we supported 3rd party status extensions in form of javascript jailed execution environment (eq Jail) + small js library exposing chat commands API to js code.

While neat in theory, it has some serious downsides:

- Design of the API was quite poor, preferring mutable semantics over stateless API leveraging strength of the host application (cljs/re-frame).
  As a result of that, more dynamic/state requiring things (like the live tx detail in `/send` command messages) were very hard to do,
  so instead of ""eating our own dogfood"", we decided to side-step the API and implement such things as hard-coded logic in the app, while partly
  retaining the js code for ""easier"" things (like parameter declaration).
  Needles to say, such efforts produced code of very poor quality, riddling our app with hard-coded ""magic"" everywhere in the codebase, completely
  defeating the point of ""dogfooding"" while still requiring more effort and being much more error prone (no way to unit test jail logic) because 
  of the need to asynchronously communicate with jail for leftover logic in command messages (the parts not hardcoded in app).
  
- We were in a state where there was not even one command defined completely in jail, with all of them requiring custom hardcoded logic in app to
  actually work.
  Due to numerous changes and rush to get things working, half of the API was obsolete and was not working/working differently then described in
  the API documentation.
  
- We are quite tight stretched regarding performance and the Jail didn't particularly help with that - whenever some command message was defined in
  Jail, it required constant RN Bridge ""ping-pong"" whenever sending the message or receiving the message, eating more resources + breaking otherwise
  quite simple logic into harder to reason asynchronous call chains (execute method defined in Jail, wait for the result, execute next method in Jail...).
  
- Till now, there was no real interest in 3rd party bots anyway - the only ""real"" DAPPs submitted to status were ""normal"" DAPPs utilising just the `web3.js`
  API and built on top of regular web technologies, so they could be ran in any Ethereum client like Metamask or Mist, besides Status.
  
- There is a very promising new concept of extensions (project pluto), which will enable to extend status with much nicer and declarative extension
  definitions.
  Such extensions will not be able to only hook-in into the command messages logic, but also other application (host) hooks, like wallet assets/collectibles,
  chat contacts, etc.","## Decision 
## Decision

Given the above context and the numerous shortcomings of the existing JavaScript Jail (Jail) system, we have decided to **deprecate and remove support for 3rd party status extensions based on the Jail execution environment**.

This decision is based on the following key factors:

- The current API design encourages poor engineering practices, leads to tightly coupled and hard-to-maintain code, and undermines our ability to ""eat our own dogfood"" by forcing critical functionality into app-side hardcoded logic.
- No command is fully implemented in Jail — all rely on fragile, synchronous workarounds that increase complexity and reduce testability.
- Performance is negatively impacted due to constant asynchronous communication across the React Native bridge, which harms user experience and increases memory and CPU usage.
- There has been no real-world adoption of Jail-based 3rd party bots or extensions; existing DApps function perfectly using standard web3.js and web-based tooling.
- A superior alternative is on the horizon with **Project Pluto**, which promises a declarative, secure, and deeply integrated extension model that supports not only chat commands but also wallet, contact, and UI integrations in a maintainable and performant way.

As part of this decision:
- We will **cease development and maintenance** of the Jail-based extension API.
- Existing Jail-dependent features will be **migrated to native implementations** or re-implemented using future Pluto-compatible patterns.
- Future extensibility efforts will focus exclusively on **Project Pluto** and its architecture.

This paves the way for a cleaner, more maintainable codebase and aligns our platform with modern, scalable extension models.","## Decision

In the light of points above, we decided to remove Jail and `Status.js` API from the application and re-work command messages in set of nicely
encapsulated app level protocols, so command related logic will be defined in one place, commands will be able to leverage strength of our platform
and development of any new functionality related to them will be much faster and more pleasant. 
We will address the 3rd party code issue separately by extensions."
"## Context

The whitepaper describes Tribute to Talk (TtT) as an economics-based anti-spam filter for receiving messages and ""cold"" contact requests from user. Stakeholders would stake a minimum amount of SNT that another Status stakeholder must deposit in order to contact him directly.
The whitepaper also proposes that the deposit is only forfeited to the recipient if he replies.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will implement Tribute to Talk (TtT) as a module that enables users to set a staking requirement for receiving direct messages or contact requests. This mechanism acts as an economics-based anti-spam filter.

Key design decisions:

- Users can configure a minimum amount of SNT (or another designated token) that must be deposited by any sender wishing to initiate a direct message or ""cold"" contact request.
- The deposit is held in escrow when the message/request is sent.
- The deposit is only transferred to the recipient if they choose to reply, serving as both compensation and incentive alignment.
- If the recipient does not reply within a defined time window, the deposit is refunded to the sender.
- Users can disable TtT or set the required stake to zero to allow free communication.
- The module integrates with the existing `x/bank` and `x/staking` modules for token transfers and balance checks.
- Deposit parameters (minimum amount, timeout duration) are configurable per user and enforceable through protobuf messages authenticated via the standard Cosmos SDK signing mechanism.

This implementation aligns with the original whitepaper vision while ensuring compatibility with the modular architecture of the Cosmos SDK.","## Decision

Considering:
- the absence of efficient ways to perform anonymous transactions (zk-snarks could be used in the future for that)
- the impossibility to prove that a recipient has made an actual reply and not some kind of automated reply (captcha solution was proposed, but wouldn't be practical until we can use a solution such as swarm feeds that allow users to make free updates to their captcha without on-chain transactions)
- the limited time to develop the feature

We opted for a solution that:
- doesn't establish a direct correlation between the tribute payment and an on-chain transaction, so it
- uses regular transactions for tributes payment, giving users plausible deniability about the nature of the payment
- doesn't store tribute information on-chain"

Currently, there is only a single team lead in the mobile development team, and after a meeting with the design team, it has been identified that the mobile app lacks polishness. One of the main issues identified is a lack of oversight in certain areas. To address this problem, it has been decided to create an additional role within the team. For each section of the mobile app (communities, syncing & onboarding, activity center & shell, wallet, messaging), a person will be selected to fulfill the responsibilities outlined below.","## Decision 
## Decision

The following responsibilities will be assigned to the new role, referred to as ""Section Owner"":

- **Ownership and Oversight**: Each Section Owner will have end-to-end responsibility for the quality, consistency, and user experience within their designated app section.
- **Design Alignment**: Work closely with the design team to ensure UI/UX fidelity, component consistency, and timely implementation of design updates.
- **Development Coordination**: Lead technical planning and execution for features and bug fixes in their section, coordinating across developers as needed.
- **Quality Assurance**: Oversee testing efforts, including identifying edge cases, ensuring test coverage, and validating release readiness.
- **Cross-Team Liaison**: Serve as the primary point of contact between the mobile team and other teams (design, backend, product) for matters concerning their section.
- **Tech Debt & Polish**: Proactively identify and prioritize polish tasks, accessibility improvements, performance issues, and technical debt within their area.

This distributed ownership model aims to improve accountability, increase attention to detail, and elevate the overall quality and coherence of the mobile application.","## Decision

The decision is to create an additional role within the mobile development team for each section. The individuals selected for these roles will have the following responsibilities:

- Ensure GitHub issues are created for new features/designs of the section.
- Ensure issues are adequately described and linked as best as possible.
- Ensure issues have a grooming session where other developers can provide their feedback before working on the set of issues.
- Ensure all relevant parties are invited, such as designers, QA, Product Owner, leads, etc., as needed (including the designer who created the feature).
- Ensure there is consensus among the developers working on the section about the decided strategy approach. Ideally, this consensus should be documented.
- Ensure UI quality by organizing designer reviews and guaranteeing pixel perfection.
- Ensure overall implementation is satisfactory based on the predefined requirements.
- Ensure alignment between desktop, web, and mobile versions for the respective section in collaboration with the mobile developers and design team.
- Act as a point of contact for the design team with respect to the section.
- Ensure that someone goes through the designs once they are created with the respective designer.
- Assist the design team with technical feasibility analysis and address any product concerns.
- Facilitate the growth of the next team member into the role.

The people identified for each sections are as follow:

- Messaging @flexsurfer, followed by @alwx
- Syncing & Onboarding @siddarthkay
- Communities @ilmotta, followed by @ajayesivan
- Activity Center & Shell @J-Son89, followed by @Parveshdhull
- Wallet (once the vertical team is created) @J-Son89, followed by @briansztamfater

This will be a rotating post, every 4 months it will go to the next in line.

The wallet team might have longer times for rotation, as stability might be more important. That's still to be decided.

"## Context

During the development of a new Sylius API (based on API Platform) for Product Options, we had to decide how we should handle
Product Option's values collection, to make it efficient and easy to use.","## Decision  
## Decision Outcome

We will model Product Option values as a dedicated resource in the Sylius API, embedded within the Product entity via API Platform’s nested subresources and attribute serialization groups.

This approach ensures:

- **Efficiency**: Values are only loaded when explicitly requested, avoiding unnecessary data fetching.
- **Consistency**: Aligns with API Platform best practices and Sylius's resource-oriented architecture.
- **Usability**: Enables clear endpoints such as `GET /api/v2/products/{id}/options` and supports filtering, pagination, and sorting where applicable.
- **Flexibility**: Supports future extensions like per-channel option value pricing or translations.

We use API Platform’s `subresourceOperations` to expose option values under their parent product, and leverage serialization groups (`product:read`, `product_option:read`) to control payload size and structure.

This decision avoids denormalizing option values into the main Product response, which would increase payload size and complexity, especially for products with many variants and options.","## Decision and reasoning

Product option values should always be provided with their IRIs. They can exist outside of the `ProductOption` resource 
(e.g. be [related with](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Component/Product/Model/ProductVariant.php#L44) `ProductVariant`).
Moreover, values embedded together with their translations in the `ProductOption` that already has its translations would
result in a massive and unmanageable response."
"## Context and Problem Statement

A big chunk of resources available in Sylius have some part locale aware. Product descriptions, names of payment or shipping methods
should be translated to the customer to provide the best user experience. Right now most of the resources are returned with 
all available translations in the store and proper localization of content is left to the frontend developers. What is more,
this solution is not consistent, as some endpoints already embeds some part of translatables in them. We should provide clear,
easy to use and consistent way of handling customer locales.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will standardize the handling of locale-aware resources in Sylius by adopting a request-driven localization approach. The API will return content localized to the requested locale, based on an explicit `Accept-Language` header or a provided locale parameter.

If no locale is specified, the store’s default locale will be used. Translations not available in the requested locale will fall back according to the locale fallback chain (e.g., `fr-CA` → `fr` → default locale).

All endpoints must:
- Accept an optional locale context via `Accept-Language` header or query parameter.
- Return only the relevant translation for the requested locale within the main resource payload.
- Omit untranslated fields only if they are required; otherwise, they may be null or excluded based on configuration.
- Avoid returning full translation arrays unless explicitly requested (e.g., via an `include=translations` parameter).

This ensures consistency across endpoints, reduces payload size, and shifts the responsibility of localization from frontend developers to the API layer, improving usability and user experience.","## Decision Outcome

The first approach should be used in admin section of API, while the third one should be used in shop section. This way, we
will receive best of both worlds with the minimal effort. It is worth mentioning that Sylius have two distinguish entry points
to API - admin and shop. They are concerned about different things and resolves different problems. Unified view of a product
in the shop will make it easy and straightforward to build product pages. At the same time all translation approach should be used in
admin to provide full control over ""translation"" resource - as we should treat them. Therefore, every resource translation
should be linked to the main resource through IRI. Each of these translation resource may be a subject of all CRUD operations
accessible throughout HTTP Verbs."

Decisions that affect the development of Terraform Controller that are not
captured via a proposal need to be captured in some way. We need a method that
is lightweight and easy to discover the decision that have been made. The record
of decisions will help future contributors to the project to understand why
something has been implemented or is done a certain way.","## Decision  
## Decision

We will use lightweight Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document decisions related to the Terraform Controller that are not captured via formal proposals. These ADRs will be stored in a dedicated `docs/adr` directory in the project repository in Markdown format.

Each ADR will follow a simplified version of the Michael Nygard template, including:

- **Title** – a short descriptive name
- **Status** – e.g., proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated
- **Context** – the problem or situation that prompted the decision
- **Decision** – the chosen solution or action
- **Date** – when the decision was made
- **Consequences** – implications, both positive and negative

This approach is lightweight, version-controlled, and easily discoverable through the codebase. It integrates naturally with pull requests and code reviews, ensuring transparency and traceability without introducing process overhead. Future contributors can quickly understand the rationale behind key implementation choices.","## Decision

To detect pull request changes, we can use webhooks or polling using GitHub's
API.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will use GitHub webhooks to detect pull request changes.

Webhooks provide real-time notifications, reduce latency in detecting changes, and decrease the load on both our systems and GitHub’s API compared to polling. This approach ensures immediate reaction to events such as PR creation, updates, or reviews, enabling faster feedback loops in CI/CD workflows. Additionally, webhooks are more scalable and align with GitHub’s recommended practices for event-driven integrations.","## Decision

We decided to start with polling for security reasons. Using webhooks would require users to
open an ingress to the cluster. Because of this requirement, we think security conscious folks may refuse to roll this out on production clusters especially in an
air-gapped environment. This does not mean that we will never consider using webhooks for this, but that initially, polling is what we have chosen to implement.

The Branch-Based Planner has two components:

1. Polling Server: Detect Pull Request changes and manage Teraform resource
   state.
2. Informer: Make a comment when new plan output is available."
"## Context

Like [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/), the tf-controller API has a handful
of places where it accepts cross-namespace references.

 - `Terraform.spec.sourceRef` -- refers to the Flux source object with
   the Terraform program
 - `Terraform.spec.dependsOn[]` -- refers to other objects that must
   be ready before this object can be run
 - `.data.resources[]` -- in the config struct used by the branch
   planner

In general in Kubernetes, references to objects in other namespaces
are frowned upon, because

 - they break namespace isolation assurances; and,
 - they encourage the proliferation of permissions.

Both of these effects make a system less secure.

However: removing cross-namespace refs entirely would break some
installations in a way that would be difficult to fix, because Flux
deployments often rely on defining sources away from objects that use
them.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will allow cross-namespace references in the tf-controller API, but with explicit opt-in via a new `namespace` field in reference types, and enforce strict permission controls to mitigate security risks.

For each cross-namespace reference (e.g., `Terraform.spec.sourceRef`, `Terraform.spec.dependsOn[]`, and `.data.resources[]`), we will:

1. **Require explicit namespace qualification**: References to objects in other namespaces must include the `namespace` field. Omitting it implies the reference is within the same namespace (default behavior).

2. **Enforce RBAC at admission control**: The controller will verify that the service account managing the referencing object has appropriate cross-namespace permissions (e.g., `get` on the referenced resource type in the target namespace) before allowing the reference.

3. **Log and audit cross-namespace references**: All cross-namespace references will be logged to aid in security auditing and troubleshooting.

4. **Document security implications**: Clear documentation will warn users about the security trade-offs of using cross-namespace references and recommend colocation of resources when possible.

This approach preserves backward compatibility and supports existing workflows while improving safety and transparency around cross-namespace dependencies.","## Decision

Deny cross-namespace references by default, but allow them to be
enabled with a flag.

So that the default value means the right thing, the flag name must be
`enable-cross-namespace-refs`, and the default `false`. To avoid
confusion when people try to use the Flux version of this flag
`--disable-cross-namespace-refs`, it should be supported too, but only
respected if supplied."
"## Context

The TF-Controller currently faces challenges related to the deletion of Terraform resources.
These problems span across three categories:

1. Single object deletion,
2. Resources with dependencies deletion, and
3. Namespace deletion.

These problems must be fixed in the above order as (2) and (3) require single object deletion to be resolved first.

Deleting a single TF object can sometimes be obstructed because it's tied to other resources like Source objects, Secrets, and ConfigMaps. If we try to remove it without deleting these resources, the TF object gets stuck in an inconsistent state, making it harder for users to manage their infrastructure smoothly.
Therefore, the TF-Controller is being enhanced to address this problem more efficiently, using the contents of generated Workspace BLOBs. Each BLOB contains all necessary information from the associated Source, Secrets, and ConfigMaps to ensure that TF-Controller finalization procedures can delete objects correctly.

Currently, the TF-Controller downloads a Source BLOB and pushes it to a tf-runner. The tf-runner processes this BLOB to create a Workspace file system. It generates a backend configuration file, variable files, and other necessary files for the Workspace file system, using data from associated Secrets and ConfigMaps. This newly created Workspace file system is then compressed, sent back to the TF-Controller, and stored as a Workspace BLOB in the controller's storage.
A caching mechanism for these BLOBs is essential to fixing the single TF object deletion process.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will implement a caching mechanism for Workspace BLOBs in the TF-Controller to enable reliable deletion of single Terraform objects.

The cache will store the most recent version of each Workspace BLOB, preserving all information required to reconstruct the associated infrastructure state, including configurations derived from Source objects, Secrets, and ConfigMaps. This cached BLOB will be retained until finalization is complete.

During deletion, if a Terraform object is blocked due to dependencies, the TF-Controller will retrieve the corresponding Workspace BLOB from the cache. Using the embedded configuration data, the controller (or an accompanying tf-runner) will perform a targeted `terraform destroy` operation scoped precisely to the resources managed by that object. This ensures dependent resources (e.g., cloud instances, networks, buckets) are cleanly removed before Kubernetes-level garbage collection proceeds.

The caching mechanism will:
- Be keyed by Terraform object identifier (namespace/name).
- Persist BLOBs through restarts using durable storage (e.g., persistent volume or object store).
- Enforce a TTL or size-based eviction policy to prevent unbounded growth.
- Be cleaned up automatically upon successful deletion finalization.

This approach decouples deletion logic from live dependency references and allows the TF-Controller to act autonomously during cleanup, significantly improving reliability and user experience. It also lays the foundation for handling dependent and namespace-scoped deletions in future iterations.","## Decision

1. **BLOB Creation and Storage**
   * A gRPC function named `CreateWorkspaceBlob` will be invoked by the TF-Controller 
     to tell tf-runner to compress the Workspace file system into a tar.gz BLOB, which is then retrieved back to the controller.
   * The caching mechanism will be executed right before the Terraform Initialization step, ensuring that the latest and most relevant data is used.
   * Each Workspace Blob will be cached on the TF-Controller's local disk, using the UUID of the Terraform object as the filename,`${uuid}.tar.gz`.
   * To reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the cache entries, and cache collisions, the cache file will be deleted after the finalization process is complete.
2. **Persistence** 
   * [The persistence mechanism used by the Source Controller](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/configuration/vertical-scaling/#persistent-storage-for-flux-internal-artifacts) will be adopted for the TF-Controller's persistence volume.
3. **BLOB Encryption**
   * The encryption and decryption of the BLOBs will be tasked to the runner, with the controller solely responsible for storing encrypted BLOBs.
   * Each namespace will require a service account, preferably named ""tf-runner"".
   * The token of this service account, which is natively supported by Kubernetes, will serve as the most appropriate encryption key because it's stored in a Secret, access to which can be controlled by RBAC. Storing it in a Secret also allows the key to be rotated.
4. **Security Measures (Based on STRIDE Analysis)**
   * **Spoofing:** Implement Kubernetes RBAC for access restrictions and use mutual authentication for gRPC communications.
   * **Tampering:** Use checksums for integrity verification and 0600 permissions to write-protect local disk storage.
   * **Repudiation:** Ensure strong logging and auditing mechanisms for tracking activities.
   * **Information Disclosure:** Utilize robust encryption algorithms, rotate encryption keys periodically, and secure service account tokens.
   * **Denial of Service:** Monitor storage space and automate cleanup processes.
   * **Elevation of Privilege:** Minimize permissions associated with service account tokens.
5. **First MVP & Future Planning**
   * For the initial MVP, the default pod local volume will be used.
   * Since a controller restart will erase the BLOB cache, consideration for using persistent volumes should be made for subsequent versions."

In previous releases of Zarf, the creation of the initialization package at the core of many of our E2E tests required repository secrets to login to registry1. Since this is an open-source project, anyone could submit a change to one of our GitHub workflows that could steal our secrets. In order to protect our secrets from any bad-actors we used [peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch@v2](https://github.com/peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch) so that only a maintainer would have the ability to run the E2E tests when a PR is submitted for review.

In the current version of Zarf (v0.15) images from registry1 are no longer needed to create the zarf-init-{{arch}}.tar.zst. This means, given our current span of E2E tests, we no longer need to use repository secrets when running tests. This gives us the ability to reassess the way we do our E2E testing.

When considering how to handle the tests, some of the important additions we were considering were:
  1. Ability to test against different kubernetes distributions
  2. Ability to test against different linux distributions
  3. Ability to run (at least some of) the E2E tests locally without relying on an ec2 instance - for quicker feedback loops when developing new features","## Decision 
## Decision

We will remove the use of `peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch@v2` and transition to automatically running E2E tests on all pull requests, without requiring maintainer intervention.

Since Zarf v0.15 no longer requires registry1 credentials to build the initialization package or run core E2E tests, repository secrets are no longer needed for the majority of our test workflows. This eliminates the security risk that previously necessitated manual trigger approval via slash commands.

As part of this change, we will:

1. Update GitHub Actions workflows to run E2E tests automatically on `pull_request` events.
2. Maintain a subset of sensitive, secret-dependent tests (if any) in a separate workflow that remains manually triggered via maintainers-only permissions.
3. Begin incremental improvements to support testing across:
   - Multiple Kubernetes distributions (e.g., K3s, Kind, Minikube)
   - Multiple Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, CentOS) via matrix testing where appropriate
4. Refactor E2E test structure to improve local execution capability, enabling developers to run a representative subset of tests using local clusters and tooling without dependency on EC2 instances.

This shift improves developer experience, accelerates feedback loops, increases transparency, and aligns with open-source best practices while maintaining security.","## Decision

The previous E2E test code was not extensible enough to be reused to test Zarf against different kubernetes distributions. The test suite was refactored so that we could write a setup and teardown function for each kubernetes distribution we wanted to verify against and the test suite was then responsible for cycling through the different distributions. This gives us the ability to test multiple kubernetes distributions against the same exact test cases.

The individual test cases were also rewritten to not rely on terratest running a bash command over ssh. Instead, the test uses the locally built Zarf binary and example packages to validate expected behavior. This approach works both on local dev machines (linux/mac) and on the Ubuntu GitHub Runner that gets triggered when a pull request is created. This also has the positive side effect of not needing to wait several minutes for an ec2 instance to spin up for testing.

Since we no longer need repository secrets to run the E2E tests, we removed the requirement for a maintainer to use a `/test all` chatops command to dispatch the tests. Instead, there is a new test workflow defined for each kubernetes distribution we are verifying against and the tests get run automatically whenever a PR is created or updated.

When looking back at the list of 'important additions' we were considering above. All three are addressed with this approach. Testing against different kubernetes distributions is as simple as defining how to create and destroy the cluster. All of the test cases are runnable locally and then because of that testing on a linux distribution is possible by just switching over to another machine and running the same `make test-e2e` there. This also gives us the ability to test against cloud distributions like EKS! All you need is a valid kubeconfig and running `go test ./...` in the `./src/test/e2e` directory will run all of the test cases against the EKS cluster."
"## Context

In order to create any workloads in K8s, an image has to exist on the node or be pulled in from an OCI Distribution server (docker registry). Local K8s distros such as KIND, K3D, K3S, Microk8s have CLI support for injecting or pushing images into the CRIs of cluster nodes. No standard or tool exists to do this generically in K8s as the CRI sits outside the problem of K8s beyond just communicating with it. For Zarf to push images into a K8s cluster that does not have a CLI option to inject the image, we have to establish some mechanism to create a temporary registry, use an existing one, or inject the image in the cluster. Zarf must also support unknown environments with no other dependencies; we cannot assume a registry exists. Typically when K8s pulls images from a remote registry, it sends the request to the CRI that then does the pull outside of the K8s context. The CRI runs at the host level on a per-node basis, so to access a private registry, the TLS trust needs to be modified on any host/node that would attempt to pull the image. The two primary ways to do this are modifying the node's root certificate authorities or the CRIs configuration if it has an option for TLS root CA. Lastly, as this is per node, all nodes in the cluster would need to be modified or some affinity/taint to force the pod to use a single node during bootstrapping.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will implement an ephemeral, in-cluster image registry as part of the Zarf agent during package deployment. This registry will be deployed as a temporary service within the target Kubernetes cluster and used exclusively for distributing OCI images contained in the Zarf package.

The workflow will be:
1. Before applying any manifests, Zarf deploys a minimal, secure container registry (e.g., using Docker Distribution or Harbor) into the cluster.
2. The registry is exposed via ClusterIP and accessible only within the cluster network.
3. Zarf pushes all required images from the package to this in-cluster registry.
4. Image references in deployment manifests are rewritten to point to the local registry service.
5. Workloads are deployed with image pull specs targeting the local registry.
6. After successful deployment, the temporary registry may be retained (for air-gapped environments) or removed based on user configuration.

This approach eliminates dependency on external registries, avoids node-level TLS trust modifications, supports multi-node clusters seamlessly, and ensures compatibility across diverse K8s environments—including those without CLI-based image loading support. It also aligns with Zarf’s goal of enabling self-contained, dependency-free deployments in isolated or restricted environments.","## Decision

Because we cannot require third-party dependencies, the requirement from some cloud-managed or distro-managed registry is not an option as not every K8s cluster will have that available.  Running an in-memory registry while zarf is performing `zarf init` was initially explored to resolve the external dependency issue.  However, this solution proved too complex when dealing with network traversal (especially behind NATs), firewall, and NACL rulesets.  Additionally, because of the complexities around TLS trust, the in-memory registry was not a viable solution.

After iterating on several solutions, including `kubectl cp`, `kubectl exec`, a busybox configmap injection that brought in netcat to stream files, and a few variations on those ideas, we found using only configmaps to be the most predictable method for injection. The challenge with this mode is that the ETCD limit is 1 MB total, with binary data base64-encoded leaving roughly 670 KBs of data per configmap, far too small to bring the registry tarball in a single configmap. So instead, we used a combination of a custom Rust binary compiled with MUSL to perform file concatenation, untarring, and verification of a set of split tarball chunks across a variable number of configmaps. We found that chunking by less than the near-maximum configmap size was more performant on some resource-constrained control planes. The details of this solution and a drawing are located in the main README of this repo."

SBOM are required for software running on government hardware per EO14028.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for all software builds intended for deployment on government hardware, in compliance with Executive Order (EO) 14028.

The SBOM will be generated using the [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) tool by Anchore, which supports comprehensive dependency enumeration and output formats including SPDX, CycloneDX, and Syft JSON. The preferred format for distribution and integration with government tooling will be **SPDX Tag-Value** due to its widespread adoption and compatibility with federal requirements.

SBOM generation will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:
- Automatically triggered on every build tagged for production or marked as a release candidate.
- Attached to the build artifacts and stored alongside them in the artifact repository.
- Signed using a cryptographic key tied to the build system to ensure integrity and provenance.

Additionally:
- The SBOM will include all direct and transitive dependencies, including operating system packages and language-level dependencies.
- For containerized deployments, the SBOM will be generated from the final container image.
- Processes will be established to provide SBOMs upon request for any released version.

This approach ensures compliance, improves supply chain transparency, and enables faster vulnerability response across deployments on government systems.","## Decision

Using Witness' Syft attestor functionality allows Zarf to continue to get more refined SBOM capabilities as Witness' capabilities expand over time. Syft is capable of finding installed packages and some binaries for statically compiled dependencies over each image within a Zarf package. This allows for SBOMs for each image to be generated and packaged along with the Zarf package.  Abilities to export the SBOM to SDPX and CycloneDX formatted documents as well as a browse-able web page are in works."
"## Context

Currently Zarf leverages [Helm Post Rendering](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/advanced/#post-rendering) to mutate image paths and secrets for K8s to use the internal [Zarf Registry](../packages/zarf-registry/). This works well for simple K8s deployments where Zarf is performing the actual manifest apply but fails when using a secondary gitops tools suchs as [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), etc. At that point, Zarf is unable to provide mutation and it is dependent on the package author to do the mutations themselves using rudimentary templating. Further, this issue also exists when for CRDs that references the [git server](../packages/gitea/). A `zarf prepare` command was added previously to make this less painful, but it still requires additional burden on package authors to do something we are able to prescribe in code.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will introduce a new `mutators` field in the Zarf package definition that allows declarative specification of transformations to be applied to Kubernetes manifests at deploy time, regardless of whether Zarf applies the manifests directly or via a GitOps tool.

This `mutators` field will support common mutation patterns such as:
- Image path rewriting (e.g., redirecting to the internal Zarf Registry)
- Secret injection or reference updating
- Service endpoint modifications (e.g., for Gitea or other embedded services)

These mutators will be executed during the deployment phase, after manifest templating but before any apply operation—whether performed by Zarf or an external GitOps controller. When using GitOps tools like Flux or ArgoCD, Zarf will pre-process the manifests using the defined mutators and commit the transformed manifests into the target repository, ensuring the correct internal references are used.

This approach shifts the burden of manual mutation from the package author to the Zarf framework, providing reliable, consistent behavior across deployment strategies while maintaining compatibility with GitOps workflows.

The `zarf prepare` command will be deprecated in favor of this more robust and integrated solution.","## Decision

A [mutating webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/) is standard practice in K8s and there [are a lot of them](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#what-does-each-admission-controller-do). Using the normal Zarf component structure and deployment strategy we can leverage a mutating webhook to perform automatic imagePullSecret binding and image path updates as well as add additional as-needed mutations such as updating the [GitRepository](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/source/gitrepositories/) CRD with the appropriate secret and custom URL for the git server if someone is using Flux."

While this solution works, it is overkill for the operations that `stage2` performs. The `stage2` binary is only responsible for 1. starting a docker registry in `rw` mode, 2. pushing the `registry:2` crane tarball into said registry, 3. starting the docker registry in `r` mode. This `registry:2` image is then immediately consumed by the `zarf-registry` package, creating a true in-cluster docker registry. The injector pod is then destroyed. The overhead this operation creates:

- having to keep track of another binary (making the total number 3 for the zarf ecosystem)
- nearly doubling the amount of configmaps loaded into the cluster (makes init slower)
- having to compile the binary for each platform (adds to the build time + ci)
- using a full-featured docker registry to host a single image (wasteful)","## Decision 
## Decision

Replace the `stage2` Go binary with a minimal Rust binary that directly serves the `registry:2` image tarball using a lightweight HTTP server, conforming to the Docker Registry HTTP API v2 for a single-image use case.

This new binary will:
- Eliminate the need to run and manage a full Docker registry instance
- Reduce resource footprint and initialization time
- Remove cross-platform compilation overhead by integrating with existing Rust build pipeline
- Decrease the number of configmaps required by embedding or streaming the tarball more efficiently
- Be embedded within the same binary as `stage1` where possible to reduce binary count

The solution will maintain compatibility with the `zarf-registry` package's expectations by implementing just enough of the Docker Registry API to serve the single image.","## Decision

The rust binary is already being injected via configmap and unpacking the tarball. There is little need to bring everything but the kitchen sink to just serve a single image. Therefore the decision is to use the rust binary to perform the entire injection process. This required a few changes to the rust binary:

- not only re-assemble + unpack the tarball, but also unpack the `registry:2` image (stored as a [crane tarball format](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/pkg/v1/tarball))
- transform the `registry:2` crane manifest to a docker v2 manifest
- spin up an HTTP server compliant with the v2 docker registry API to serve the `registry:2` image"
"## Context

There are sections of the code that are not easily able to be tested by our end-to-end testing and now that Zarf is moving into being a library for other products there will be more scrutiny around our defined interfaces.  This ADR explores ways that we could adjust our testing strategy to address these concerns.

Potential considerations:

1. Introduce Unit-Testing Zarf-wide
    Pros:
        - More of the codebase is covered with tests and will force us to take more consideration when updating it
    Cons:
        - As the codebase evolves the efficacy of these tests is likely to go down, especially if they are written to the code rather than the interface

2. Introduce Unit Testing in a defined and limited capacity within Zarf
    Pros:
        - A decent amount of the codebase will be tested (specifically we can target those areas difficult to e2e test)
        - We can be picky about what/where we unit test so that the maintenance burden of the tests is not too high
    Cons:
        - We will need to be vigilant when PRs come through with Unit Tests that these are correct applications of them

3. Introduce Integration Testing or partial End-to-End testing
    Pros:
        - This is closer to how we already test within Zarf
    Cons:
        - These can be relatively complex to orchestrate and maintain over time requiring complex mocks or other mechanisms to make them work","## Decision 
## Decision

We will adopt **Option 2: Introduce Unit Testing in a defined and limited capacity within Zarf**.

Unit tests will be introduced selectively to cover areas of the codebase that are:
- Difficult or impractical to test through end-to-end testing
- Stability-critical (e.g. package generation, image/manifest handling, configuration parsing)
- Well-defined in scope and interface-bound rather than implementation-bound

We will prioritize writing unit tests that validate public interfaces and exported functions, especially those intended for use by external consumers now that Zarf is evolving into a library. Tests should be focused on pure functions, data transformation logic, and error handling paths that do not require complex system setup.

To mitigate maintenance burden:
- A `TESTING.md` guide will be created to document when unit tests are appropriate vs. discouraged
- PR reviews will enforce that new unit tests align with the strategy (e.g. avoid over-mocking, prefer table-driven tests, focus on behavior not implementation)
- We will favor minimal mocking and instead use dependency injection where needed to isolate components

Integration and partial e2e tests will remain our primary validation mechanism for system-level behavior, while unit tests fill targeted gaps in coverage and increase confidence in library-style usage.","## Decision

It was decided to introduce a limited set of unit tests to the Zarf codebase (2) because this will enable us the most flexibility and control over how we test while also allowing us to specifically target specific units without a ton of overhead.  Specifically we will ask the following before implementing a Unit Test:

1. Is what I want to test a true unit (i.e. a single function or file)?
2. Does what I want to test have a clearly defined interface (i.e. a public specification)?
3. Is this code inside of the `src/pkg` folder or should it be?"
"## Context

Images are not the only way that dependencies can be brought in via a Zarf package (our own init package has two components that are not images yet could have vulnerabilities within them, k3s and the injector).  We should SBOM these in addition to images so that we are providing a more complete picture to our users.

Potential considerations:

1. Run Syft against the entire zarf temp build directory
    Pros:
        - This would provide the most information for what _might_ be in a Zarf package
    Cons:
        - If git repos are brought in you could catch many index files that are actually not in the package but are dependencies of the repos leading to confusion

2. Run Syft against files and dataInjections
    Pros:
        - We know these files are actually inside of the package and won't just be noise
        - This is the most common two ways for people to include additional artifacts in packages (we use files in our own init package)
    Cons:
        - This is only a subset of what Zarf provides and someone could commit an artifact to a git repo for example

3. Allow user flexibility in what gets SBOMed
    Pros:
        - This provides the user the most flexibility
    Cons:
        - This could be complex to get right on implementation and if it were optional may be a forgotten feature by most users","## Decision  
## Decision

We will implement **Option 2: Run Syft against files and dataInjections**.

This approach strikes the right balance between completeness and accuracy by focusing on artifacts that are definitively included in the package. While it does not cover every possible vector (e.g., files embedded in git repos), it captures the most common and intentional methods of including non-image dependencies—specifically `files` and `dataInjections`—which are already used in our init package.

By avoiding scanning the entire build directory, we prevent noise from transient or irrelevant files (e.g., Git metadata, local build artifacts), which could mislead users about actual package contents. Additionally, this method aligns well with Zarf’s declarative packaging model, where explicit file inclusion is preferred.

Although Option 3 offers more flexibility, the added complexity and risk of inconsistent usage outweigh its benefits for now. We can revisit extensibility in the future once we have clearer user requirements.

Thus, running Syft only on declared `files` and `dataInjections` ensures a reliable, maintainable, and useful SBOM generation process that reflects real package contents without introducing confusion.","## Decision

It was decided that we would SBOM the files and dataInjections inclusions by component (2) and include them into our SBOM viewer that way.  This will allow us to characterize what SBOMing in Zarf may look like going forward without introducing something that is just optional or that might make too much noise at first blush."
"## Context

Zarf was rooted in the idea of declarative K8s deployments for disconnected environments. Many of the design decisions made in Zarf are based on this idea. However, in certain connected environments, Zarf can still be leveraged as a way to define declarative deployments and upgrades without the constraints of disconnected environments. To that end, providing a declarative way to deploy Zarf packages without the need for a Zarf init package would be useful in such environments.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will introduce a new `zarf.yaml` field called `initRequired` (default: `true`) that allows package authors to specify whether the Zarf init package is required for deployment. When set to `false`, the `zarf init` command will be skipped during `zarf deploy`, and the package will be deployed directly using the cluster configuration from the local kubeconfig.

This enables use of Zarf's declarative deployment and upgrade capabilities in connected environments without requiring airgap tooling or pre-pushed images. The following behaviors apply when `initRequired: false`:

- `zarf deploy` does not expect or require a Zarf-generated seed image.
- Images, manifests, and other resources are pulled directly from their upstream sources as defined in the package.
- Git repos and data URLs are fetched at deploy time.
- The Zarf agent still runs to inject variables and manage secrets unless explicitly disabled.
- The `zarf init` command remains available but is optional for these packages.

Package authors must ensure all referenced artifacts are accessible from the target cluster’s network when using `initRequired: false`. This mode is intended for development, CI/CD, or trusted connected environments where airgap constraints do not apply.","## Decision

YOLO mode is an optional boolean config set in the `metadata` section of the Zarf package manifest. Setting `metadata.yolo=true` will deploy the Zarf package ""as is"" without needing the Zarf state to exist or the Zarf Agent mutating webhook. Zarf packages with YOLO mode enabled are not allowed to specify components with container images or Git repos and validation will prevent the package from being created."
"## Context

Originally, the `scripts` noun was added to components to allow us to move hard-coded init business logic out of the codebase and into the package system. At the time there was only a `before` and `after` section with simply an array entry per command. Later, `prepare` was added as a way to do something during `zarf package create`. As teams began to find new ways to use the capabilities, their limitations became more obvious.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will expand and formalize the `scripts` functionality within components to provide greater flexibility, clarity, and lifecycle control. The updated `scripts` section will support the following well-defined phases:

- `before`: Executes prior to component deployment. Useful for pre-requisite checks or environment setup.
- `after`: Executes after component deployment. Ideal for post-deployment configuration or validation.
- `prepare`: Executes during `zarf package create`. Used to bundle assets or generate files that should be included in the package.
- `validate`: Runs during deployment to confirm the component’s requirements are met (e.g., connectivity, permissions).
- `onFailure`: Optional script that runs if any of the preceding scripts or the component itself fails.

Each script phase will support:
- Multiple commands expressed as a list.
- Inline scripts or references to external script files.
- Environment variable injection.
- Cross-platform compatibility hints (e.g., `shell: bash` or `shell: powershell`).

This change preserves backward compatibility while enabling advanced use cases through a consistent, documented interface. Documentation will be updated to include examples, execution order, and error handling behavior.","## Decision

The `scripts` section of the `zarf.yaml` will be replaced with a new `actions` section. The `actions` section will be a map of action names to a list of commands to run. `actions` will contain `action sets` that map to the following lifecycle events:

- `onCreate` - Runs during `zarf package create`
- `onDeploy` - Runs during `zarf package deploy`
- `onRemove` - Runs during `zarf package remove`

In addition to adding more lifecycle events, the `actions` section will also allow for more complex actions to be defined. New configurations include, setting the cmd directory, defining custom env variables, setting the number of retries, setting the max total seconds, muting the output, and [setting a variable](../docs/3-create-a-zarf-package/7-component-actions.md#creating-dynamic-variables-from-actions) to be used in other actions or components.

Further details can be found in the `component-actions` [component actions documentation](../docs/3-create-a-zarf-package/7-component-actions.md), [package create lifecycle documentation](../docs/3-create-a-zarf-package/5-package-create-lifecycle.md), [package deploy lifecycle documentation](../docs/4-deploy-a-zarf-package/1-package-deploy-lifecycle.md), and the [example package](../examples/component-actions/README.md)."
"## Context

There has been a long-standing usability gap with Zarf when doing local development due to a lack of local image support. A solution was merged in, [#1173](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/pull/1173), and released in [v0.23.4](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/releases/tag/v0.23.4) to support this feature. Unfortunately, we didn't realize there is a [glaring issue](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/1214) with the implementation that causes Zarf to crash when trying to load large images into the local docker daemon.  The docker daemon support in Crane is somewhat naive and can send a machine into an OOM condition due to how the tar stream is loaded into memory from the docker save action. Crane does have an option to avoid this issue, but at the cost of being much slower to load images from docker.

We did extensive investigation into various strategies of loading docker images from the daemon including: crane, skopeo, the docker go client and executing the docker cli directly with varying levels of success. Unfortunately, some of the methods that did work well were up to 3 times slower than the current implementation, though they avoided the OOM issue. Lastly, the docker daemon save operations directly still ended up being slower than crane and docker produced a legacy format that would cause issues with [future package schema changes](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/1319) we are planning for oci imports.

|                                                    | **Docker** | **Crane** |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Big Bang Core (cached)                             | 3m 1s      | 1m 58s    |
| Big Bang Core (cached + skip-sbom)                 | 1m 51s     | 56s       |
| 20 GB Single-Layer Image (local registry)          |            | 6m 14s    |
| 20 GB Single-Layer Image (local registry + cached) | 5m 2s      | 2m 10s    |","## Decision 
## Decision

We will revert the local image support feature until a more robust solution can be implemented that avoids both the OOM condition and significant performance degradation. While this means temporarily losing a highly requested capability, maintaining system stability and performance is prioritized.

We will continue investigating alternative approaches, including:
- Using crane with the memory-safe option despite its performance cost, potentially behind a user flag for large images
- Implementing streaming tar handling to process images in chunks rather than loading entirely into memory
- Exploring hybrid approaches that use different tools based on image size or layer count
- Contributing improvements upstream to crane's docker daemon handling

Local image support will be reintroduced in a future release when a solution is found that meets both stability and performance requirements, with clear documentation about limitations and trade-offs.","## Decision

We had hoped to leverage docker caching and avoid crane caching more, but realized that caching was still occurring via Syft for SBOM. Additionally, the extremely-large, local-only image is actually the edge case here and we created a recommended workaround in the FAQs as well as an inline alert when a large docker image is detected. This restores behavior to what it was before the docker daemon support was added, but with the added benefit of being able to load images from the docker daemon when they are available locally."
"## Context

One primary application component that end users of Zarf are deploying is [Big Bang](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang). The installation of Big Bang is complicated for several reasons:

- It requires Flux to be installed to deploy correctly due to the use of Flux CRDs.
- The [images](https://umbrella-bigbang-releases.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/umbrella/1.51.0/package-images.yaml) defined within Big Bang are normally a superset of the images needed for any individual deployment.
- All images that Big Bang might need takes 10s of gigabytes of storage to include in a Zarf package.
- The git repositories defined within Big Bang are normally a superset of the git repositories needed for any individual deployment.
- Injecting a `values.yaml` file into the [default deployment structure](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/blob/master/base/kustomization.yaml) is complicated and the discovery of which images are needed is a function of the values that are provided to the Big Bang chart","## Decision 
## Decision

To support efficient and flexible deployment of Big Bang with Zarf, we will implement a **Big Bang Integration Pattern** that combines the following approaches:

- **Flux Pre-Requisite**: Require Flux to be pre-installed or deployed as part of the Zarf package initialization, ensuring CRDs are available before Big Bang components are applied.
  
- **Dynamic Image & Git Repository Inclusion**: Instead of bundling all possible Big Bang images and git repos, use Zarf's ability to define templated or conditional resources. Leverage `zarf.yaml` transformations and user-provided values to determine which images and repositories are actually required for a given deployment.

- **Values Injection via Kustomize Overlay**: Create a Zarf-managed overlay structure that injects user-defined `values.yaml` into the Big Bang Kustomization pipeline. This allows customization of Big Bang behavior while preserving upstream compatibility.

- **Image List Pruning Based on Values**: Implement tooling (potentially external to Zarf but used in package creation) that parses the provided `values.yaml` and determines the minimal set of required images and git repositories by analyzing enabled components and dependencies. This drastically reduces package size.

- **Documentation and Example Package**: Provide a reference Zarf package example and documentation that demonstrates how to construct a minimal, values-driven Big Bang deployment using this pattern.

This approach ensures that Big Bang can be deployed securely and efficiently in air-gapped environments using Zarf, without requiring massive, monolithic packages containing unused assets.","## Decision

Deployments of Big Bang can be managed with a new `bigbang` noun in the zarf.yaml that manages the complexity of the deployment. This capability will take the values provided to the big bang chart, template them during the package phase to identify which [Big Bang packages](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/blob/master/docs/packages.md) are being configured in the Zarf package. The code then includes only the git repositories and images needed for the configured packages, and does not include the git repositories and images for packages that would not be deployed.

The `bigbang` section will provide the following configurations for managing a big bang deployment:

- `version` - Identifies the particular version of Big Bang to deploy, which corresponds to git tags in the provided `repo`. See versions of Big Bang [here](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/releases).
- `repo` - Identifies the git repository Big Bang is hosted on. Defaults to https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang.git
- `valuesFiles` - list of local files that get passed to the Big Bang helm chart for deployment.
- `skipFlux` - boolean to determine if the flux installation for Big Bang should be skipped. Only set this to true if flux has been deployed in a different way already in the cluster."
"## Context

Zarf packages are currently only available if built locally or through manual file transfers. This is not a scalable way to distribute packages. We wanted to find a way to distribute and publish packages in a way that is easily consumable for the majority of users. When considering the goal of being able to share packages, security and trust are very important considerations. We wanted our publishing solution and architecture changes to keep in mind signing of packages and the ability to verify the integrity of packages.

We know we are successful when:

1. (Priority) Users can use Zarf to natively publish a Zarf package to an OCI compliant registry
2. (Secondary goal) Package creators can sign Zarf packages to enable package deployers can trust a packages supply chain security","## Decision 
## Decision

We will integrate Zarf with OCI (Open Container Initiative) registries to enable native publishing and distribution of Zarf packages. This allows users to push and pull Zarf packages just like container images, leveraging existing, widely adopted infrastructure.

To support supply chain security and trust:
- Zarf packages will be signed using cryptographic signatures at publish time.
- Package signatures will follow industry standards (e.g., Cosign or Sigstore) to allow verification upon deployment.
- Zarf will verify package integrity and signature authenticity by default before deploying a package from a registry.

This approach meets the primary goal of scalable, standardized distribution via OCI registries, and the secondary goal of enabling verifiable, secure software supply chains.","## Decision

We decided that changing the structure of Zarf packages to be an OCI artifact would be the best way to distribute and publish packages as registries are already an integral part of the container ecosystem."
"## Context

Zarf currently supports git servers and container registries within the airgap to host dependencies for applications, and while this works well for most production deployments, it doesn't cater as well to airgap development where you may need artifacts and libraries for various coding languages to compile and develop software.  Zarf's support of `git` is also somewhat lacking in that it only supports flux `GitRepository` objects and does not support more generic use cases where clients try to reach out to upstream `git` hosts in a more native way.","## Decision 
## Decision

Introduce an air-gapped artifact registry in Zarf to support development workflows by enabling the distribution of language-specific packages (e.g., npm, pip, Maven, RubyGems) within isolated environments.

Extend Zarf’s `git` service to support generic `git` proxying, allowing developers to interact with internal or upstream git servers using standard git protocols (HTTPS/SSH), while still operating within the airgap through mirrored or cached repositories.

These additions will:
- Improve developer experience in airgapped environments by providing access to build-time dependencies.
- Support both declarative (via Zarf packages) and interactive (via native tooling) workflows.
- Maintain security and reproducibility by ensuring all artifacts are pre-approved and synchronized through the Zarf package pipeline.

The implementation will prioritize compatibility with common CI/CD tools and language package managers, ensuring minimal disruption to existing development practices.","## Decision

Since we already had an artifact registry available to us in Gitea, it was decided to utilize that as the default provider for this functionality in addition to matching the external support for `git` and `registry` servers with a new `artifact` server specification on `init`.  From here, to access the configured server we had two main options:

1. Transform any artifact references statically (i.e. swap upstream URLs in build scripts before bringing them into the environment)
2. Transform any artifact references dynamically (i.e. swap upstream URLs in an active proxy that any build scripts could pickup through DNS)

It was decided to go with #2 since this would allow us to support a wider array of build technologies (including those that wrap existing commands like Buck/Bazel/Make) as well as support builds that may be coming from resources not brought in by Zarf.  This allows for more flexibility in how Zarf could transform URLs while allowing these commands to run as they would on the internet side without any modification."
"## Context

Eventually, Zarf needs to become a ""Generally Available"" v1.x.x product that people can rely on for mission-critical operations.  Today, Zarf can be used in these environments; though, it requires someone more involved in the Zarf lifecycle than a normal consumer/user to make that successful due to the regular introduction of breaking changes and the lack of testing in certain areas.","## Decision 
## Decision

Zarf will adopt a formal release and versioning strategy aligned with Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to achieve General Availability (v1.0.0). This includes:

- **Stabilization of the public API**: All CLI commands, configuration schema, and package format will be considered stable post-v1.0.0. Breaking changes will require a major version increment and undergo a deprecation period.
- **Introduction of a release lifecycle**: Implement alpha, beta, and release candidate (RC) phases for new major and minor versions to allow early feedback while protecting production users from instability.
- **Expanded test coverage**: Establish comprehensive automated testing, including unit, integration, end-to-end, and upgrade tests across supported platforms and configurations, to ensure reliability.
- **Long-term support (LTS) planning**: Define an LTS policy for future v1.x releases, guaranteeing security patches and critical bug fixes for a defined period.
- **Improved documentation and changelogs**: Maintain detailed, human-readable release notes and migration guides for any changes that affect users.

This approach ensures Zarf becomes production-ready, predictable, and maintainable for mission-critical use without requiring deep involvement in its development process.","## Decision

To make Zarf a Generally Available product we need to focus on overall stability and mechanisms to ensure long-term stability.  ""Stability,"" in this case, is both that of the features we release and of the APIs and schemas we present to Zarf consumers.

To increase this stability, we decided to implement the following:

- [ ] Mechanism/branching strategy to backport patch fixes to older minor releases
- [x] Clear definition of `released`, `beta`, and `alpha` features, including a matrix of their support across OSes
- [ ] Clear definition of when backward compatibility checks are going to be removed with clear messaging to users
- [ ] End to End testing that covers the `released` features outlined in that feature matrix - this should also be done:
  - across operating systems (specifically: Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - across major k8s distros (specifically: K3d, K3s, Minikube, Kind, EKS, AKS, OpenShift)
  - across registry providers (specifically: Docker Distribution, ECR, ACR)
  - across git providers (specifically: Gitea, GitLab)
- [ ] Unit testing that covers our library code (`src/pkg`) for people using Zarf as a library (code coverage metric TBD)
- [ ] Mechanisms and tests to not break compatibility with packages built with older versions of Zarf
- [ ] Mechanisms to notify users when they may need to upgrade the Zarf Agent (or Pepr capability)
- [ ] Mechanisms to ensure users can easily access documentation specific to the version of Zarf they use
- [ ] Mechanisms to ensure a more seamless Zarf install experience (i.e., macOS binary signing, `sudo apk add zarf`, `asdf install zarf X.X.X`)
- [ ] Regularly published/maintained example package(s) for tutorials/quick install
- [ ] Clear definition/strategy for ""what Zarf is"" including clear docs on how to use `released` features

"## Context

The idea of `hooks` is to provide a way for cluster maintainers to register functionality that runs during the deployment lifecycle. Zarf packages already have the concept of `actions` that can execute commands on the host machine's shell during certain package lifecycle events. As `actions` gain more adoption, the team has noticed they are being used to add functionality to Zarf in unexpected ways. We want `actions` to be a tool that extends upon the functionality of Zarf and its packages, not a tool that works around missing or clunky functionality.

We want package creators to be able to create system agnostic packages by leveraging core Zarf functionality. The following is one such scenario:

- _IF_ ECR is chosen as the external registry during `zarf init` / cluster creation, _THEN_ Zarf will seamlessly leverage ECR without requiring advanced user effort.

Using ECR as a remote registry creates 2 problems that Zarf will need to solve:

 1. ECR authentication tokens expire after 12 hours and need to be refreshed. This means the cluster will need to constantly be refreshing its tokens and the user deploying packages will need to make sure they have a valid token.
 2. ECR Image Repositories do not support 'push-to-create'. This means we will need to explicitly create an image repository for every image that is being pushed within the Zarf package.

Packages that get deployed onto a cluster initialized with ECR as its remote registry will need to make sure it solves these 2 problems.

Currently there are 2 solutions:

1. The package deployer solves the problem pre-deployment (creating needed repos, secrets, etc...)
2. The package itself solves these problems with `actions` that are custom built for ECR clusters.

Neither one of these current solutions are ideal. We don't want to require overly complex external + prior actions for Zarf package deployments, and we don't want package creators to have to create and distribute packages that are specific to ECR.

Potential considerations:","## Decision 
## Decision

Introduce `hooks` as a core Zarf concept to handle lifecycle events that require conditional, automated behavior based on cluster state or configuration — such as using ECR as the remote registry.

`hooks` will be built-in, declarative operations managed by Zarf (not shell commands like `actions`) and will execute automatically during package deployment when predefined conditions are met. They will run in the context of the Zarf agent on the cluster and will have access to cluster and package metadata.

Specifically for ECR:

- A `pre-push` hook will be implemented to automatically create ECR repositories if they do not exist prior to image push.
- A `registry-auth` hook will be triggered when deploying to an ECR-backed cluster, ensuring fresh authentication tokens are generated and configured both on the deployer host and within the cluster (via secret refresh) before image operations occur.

These hooks will be automatically enabled when `zarf init` detects ECR as the chosen registry. No additional configuration or custom scripting will be required in Zarf packages.

This approach ensures:
- Packages remain system-agnostic and reusable across different registry types.
- Cluster-specific logic is encapsulated in Zarf, not pushed to users or package authors.
- Common pain points (like token expiry and repo creation) are handled transparently.

Over time, `hooks` may expand to support other conditional behaviors, but they will remain focused on solving cross-cutting concerns that should not be delegated to `actions`.","## Decision

[Pepr](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/pepr) will be used to enable custom, or environment-specific, automation tasks to be integrated in the Zarf package deployment lifecycle. Pepr also allows the Zarf codebase to remain agnostic to any third-party APIs or dependencies that may be used.

A `--skip-webhooks` flag has been added to `zarf package deploy` to allow users to opt out of Zarf checking and waiting for any webhooks to complete during package deployments."
"## Context

We need a way to decouple transformations from Zarf. We know the Zarf transformation library is battle tested, hardened, and reliable. As Pepr takes admission responsibilities from the Zarf Agent, we need a way to synchronize the TypeScript with the Go code instead of maintaining two disparate libraries which will be expected to grow.

We considered:

- WASM
- gRPC
- REST
- Rewrite the code in TypeScript","## Decision 
## Decision

We will use WebAssembly (WASM) to compile the Go-based Zarf transformation library into a binary that can be executed directly within the Pepr runtime (TypeScript/Node.js environment). 

This approach ensures:
- **Consistency**: The same transformation logic is used across Zarf and Pepr, eliminating drift between implementations.
- **Maintainability**: Only one source of truth (Go code) needs to be maintained and updated.
- **Performance**: WASM provides near-native execution speed compared to REST/gRPC inter-process communication.
- **Decoupling**: Pepr does not need to run a separate service or manage network calls (as with gRPC/REST).
- **Feasibility**: Go has strong, well-supported tooling for compiling to WASM, and Node.js supports WASM execution natively.

Rewriting the transformation logic in TypeScript was rejected due to the risk of behavioral divergence, increased maintenance burden, and loss of confidence in correctness. Similarly, gRPC and REST were rejected because they introduce operational complexity, latency, and failure modes related to networking.

By embedding the Go transformation logic via WASM, we achieve tight integration, reliability, and long-term sustainability.","## Decision

We conformed around using WASM because we can leverage the battle tested transform library from Zarf without incurring network overhead cost from pod to pod or container to container communications."

Zarf natively supports creating the following package sources:

- Local Tarball (`.tar` and `.tar.zst`)
  - Via `zarf package create <dir> -o <dir>`, with compression determined by `metadata.uncompressed` in `zarf.yaml`
- Split Tarball (`.part...`)
  - Via `zarf package create <dir> --max-package-size <size> -o <dir>`
- OCI package (`oci://`)
  - Via `zarf package publish <source> oci://` or `zarf package create <dir> -o oci://...`
- In-cluster (Deployed) package
  - Post `zarf package deploy <source>` the package is show in `zarf package list`

However, the current loading abilities of Zarf have been inconsistent depending upon the action specified. For example:

- Split tarball packages could be created, deployed, but not inspected, or removed
- In-cluster packages could be removed (by name), but not inspected
- HTTPs URLs could be deployed, but not inspected, or removed
- etc...","## Decision 
## Decision

Standardize Zarf package loading across all commands to support all native package sources for the following actions:

- `zarf package create`
- `zarf package deploy`
- `zarf package remove`
- `zarf package inspect`

This ensures consistent behavior regardless of package source type. Specifically:

- Support **split tarball packages** (`*.partNNN`) in `inspect` and `remove` operations by reconstructing the full package from its parts when needed.
- Enable **in-cluster (deployed) packages** to be fully inspected via `inspect`, showing metadata, components, and deployed resources.
- Allow **HTTPS URLs** to be used with `inspect` and `remove`, treating them as remote references that can be resolved and validated prior to action.
- Fully integrate **OCI registry packages** (`oci://`) into all command flows, ensuring they can be created (via publish), deployed, inspected, and removed consistently.

This standardization improves UX, reduces confusion, and enables automation tooling to interact uniformly with any package source. Future work will document expected behaviors and validate edge cases per source type.","## Decision

Zarf must support the `deploy`, `inspect`, `remove`, `publish`, `pull`, and `mirror-resources` commands across package sources.

For common behavior to be exhibited by all sources, the `PackageSource` interface has been introduced along with the `layout` library.

```go
// src/pkg/packager/sources/new.go

// PackageSource is an interface for package sources.
//
// While this interface defines three functions, LoadPackage, LoadPackageMetadata, and Collect; only one of them should be used within a packager function.
//
// These functions currently do not promise repeatability due to the side effect nature of loading a package.
type PackageSource interface {
    // LoadPackage loads a package from a source.
    //
    // For the default sources included in Zarf, package integrity (checksums, signatures, etc.) is validated during this function
    // and expects the package structure to follow the default Zarf package structure.
    //
    // If your package does not follow the default Zarf package structure, you will need to implement your own source.
    LoadPackage(*layout.PackagePaths) error
    // LoadPackageMetadata loads a package's metadata from a source.
    //
    // This function follows the same principles as LoadPackage, with a few exceptions:
    //
    // - Package integrity validation will display a warning instead of returning an error if
    //   the package is signed but no public key is provided. This is to allow for the inspection and removal of packages
    //   that are signed but the user does not have the public key for.
    LoadPackageMetadata(dst *layout.PackagePaths, wantSBOM bool, skipValidation bool) error

    // Collect relocates a package from its source to a tarball in a given destination directory.
    Collect(destinationDirectory string) (tarball string, err error)
}
```

The following sources have been implemented:

- Local Tarball (`.tar` and `.tar.zst`)
- Split Tarball (`.part...`)
- HTTP(S) URL
- Published OCI package (`oci://`)
- In-cluster (Deployed) package (`inspect` and `remove` only)

The `layout` library contains the `PackagePaths` struct which supersedes the prior `TempPaths` struct. This new struct contains access methods to different aspects of Zarf's internal package layout. This struct is passed to the `PackageSource` functions to allow for the loading of packages into the correct layout. In order for a package to be loaded into the correct layout, the package must follow the default Zarf package structure, or be converted to the expected structure during loading operations."
"## Context

Zarf has supports composing components together between packages on `zarf package create` since v0.16.0.  This has allowed package creators to make more complex packages from smaller reusable bits.  As this functionality grew however there were a few problems that developed:

1. Import chains did not handle scaling to larger numbers of layers with test coverage usually only covering the first import.
2. When OCI skeletons were added they were largely bolted on after the fact without rethinking how they would impact composability.
3. Component filtering via the `only` filter was not implemented in a central location leading to bugs with create-time filters.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will refactor the component composition logic to introduce a centralized composition engine that handles all forms of component inclusion—whether from local packages, remote Zarf packages, or OCI-based skeletons. This engine will:

- Enforce strict validation at each layer of the import chain, ensuring metadata, dependencies, and schema compatibility are verified recursively.
- Unify component filtering (including the `only` filter) within the composition engine to eliminate inconsistencies between create-time and deploy-time behavior.
- Treat OCI skeletons as first-class composition sources by integrating them into the same resolution and validation pipeline as local and remote packages.
- Require test coverage for multi-layer compositions in CI/CD, with tooling to generate and verify deep import scenarios.

This design ensures scalability, reliability, and maintainability of package composition while preserving backward compatibility through adapter layers where necessary.","## Decision

We decided to separate composability into its own package that represents a composability import chain as a doubly linked list.  This allows us to represent the whole chain as it exists relative to the ""head"" Zarf package (the definition that Zarf was asked to build) to more easily handle packages that are in different locations (such as OCI skeletons in one's cache).  We also run the compose functions on all components so that the additional filter logic that is needed for these components can be handled more concisely and built upon (as it might for `flavor` https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/2101)."
"## Context

> Feature request: <https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/2169>

The current package development lifecycle is:

1. Create a `zarf.yaml` file and add components
2. Create a package with `zarf package create <dir>`
3. Debug any create errors and resolve by editing `zarf.yaml` and repeating step 2
4. Run `zarf init` to initialize the cluster
5. Deploy the package with `zarf package deploy <tarball>`
6. Debug any deploy errors and resolve by editing `zarf.yaml` and repeating step 2 or 5

If there are deployment errors, the common pattern is to reset the cluster (ex: `k3d cluster delete && k3d cluster create`) and repeat steps 4-6. Re-initializing the cluster, recreating the package, and redeploying the package is tedious and time consuming; especially when the package is large or the change was small.

`zarf package create` is designed around air-gapped environments where the package is created in one environment and deployed in another. Due to this architecture, a package's dependencies _must_ be retrieved and assembled _each_ and _every_ time.

There already exists the concept of [`YOLO` mode](0010-yolo-mode.md), which can build + deploy a package without the need for `zarf init`, and builds without fetching certain heavy dependencies (like Docker images). However, `YOLO` mode is not exposed via CLI flags, and is meant to develop and deploy packages in fully connected environments.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will introduce a new `--skip-create` flag for the `zarf package deploy` command to streamline iterative development.

When `--skip-create` is used:
- The `zarf package create` step is bypassed
- Zarf assumes a valid `zarf.yaml` exists in the current directory
- The deployment process proceeds directly using the existing configuration
- Dependencies are resolved dynamically at deploy time (similar to YOLO mode)
- This mode only works in connected environments where dependencies can be fetched on-demand

This flag enables faster iteration during package development by eliminating the need to recreate the entire package for minor changes. It complements but does not replace the existing air-gapped workflow - the standard `create` + `deploy` cycle remains unchanged for production and air-gapped use cases.

The `--skip-create` flag makes YOLO-mode functionality accessible through a documented, explicit CLI interface while maintaining the security and offline capabilities that are core to Zarf's design.","## Decision

Introduce a `dev deploy` command that will combine the lifecycle of `package create` and `package deploy` into a single command. This command will:

- Not result in a re-usable tarball / OCI artifact
- Not have any interactive prompts
- Not require `zarf init` to be run by default (override-able with a CLI flag)
- Be able to create+deploy a package in either YOLO mode (default) or prod mode (exposed via a CLI flag)
- Only build + deploy components that _will_ be deployed (contrasting with `package create` which builds _all_ components regardless of whether they will be deployed)"

Migrate the documentation site from Docusaurus 2 to VitePress.

VitePress offers better build performance, lighter runtime, and tighter integration with Vue 3 and the Vite ecosystem.

"## Context

Zarf is currently using an in-house built logging solution which in turn depends on pterm. This solution is used to output information to the end user who is using the Zarf CLI. This output is for the most part formatted with the purpose of CLI user experience. Logging function calls are done both in the CLI specific code as well as in the packages. The logging is implemented in such a way that different levels exist with different impacts and log destinations. A common pattern that is used is to call `message.Fatal` whenever an error occurs. This will output the message to STDERR while writing the actual error message to a debug log and exiting the program. Exiting the program in this manner makes unit testing difficult while also skipping proper context handling and skipping any clean-up that was intended to run before exiting the program. Some logging components like the progress bar and spinner are accessed through a shared global state that is not thread safe. The coupling to logging becomes complicated as disabling the progress bar is a challenge while multi threading these functions which access the global state resulting in complicated access patterns.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will refactor Zarf’s logging system to decouple core logic from direct logging and program termination, improving testability, concurrency safety, and context management.

Key changes include:

* **Replace direct os.Exit calls in logging with error propagation**:  
  Functions that encounter fatal errors will return them instead of calling `message.Fatal`, which internally calls `os.Exit`. This allows proper defer execution, cleanup routines, and enables unit testing by letting callers decide how to handle failures.

* **Introduce a structured logging interface with leveled output**:  
  We retain the use of pterm for formatting but abstract it behind a logging interface. This enables injection of mock loggers in tests and supports future extensibility (e.g., JSON logging, telemetry). Log levels (debug, info, warn, error, fatal) are preserved, but ""fatal"" actions are handled externally by the CLI layer, not within the logger itself.

* **Eliminate shared global state in progress indicators**:  
  The progress bar and spinner components will be redesigned as instances managed by a central, thread-safe controller. Each long-running operation receives its own progress instance, avoiding race conditions and enabling concurrent operations. Disabling or mocking progress output becomes possible via configuration or substitution.

* **Adopt context-aware logging**:  
  Where appropriate, we pass `context.Context` into functions so that logging can be correlated with request lifecycles, support cancellation, and carry metadata (e.g., operation IDs).

* **Introduce a debug vs user-output separation**:  
  Debug-level logs (intended for developers or advanced users) are written to a debug log file, while user-facing messages are rendered on STDOUT/STDERR using structured formatting optimized for CLI UX. Fatal error details are shown to users only when appropriate, with stack traces reserved for debug mode.

This change improves maintainability, supports reliable unit and integration testing, enables safe parallel execution, and lays the foundation for observability enhancements.","## Decision

I am proposing to completely refactor the logging functionality to follow a more standardized format using the newish slog interfaces. On top of that we would refactor the current internationalization by converting them to standardized errors.

* Replace the message package with a slog interface.
* Replace the lang package with static errors.
* Remove any use of `message.Fatal` and instead return errors.
* Refactor use of `message.WarnErr` to either return error or to log the error.
* Refactor existing functions that print formatted outputs to defer the printing to the CLI.
* Define a new interface for spinner and progress bar that is passed in as a function parameter.

The message package currently exports the following functions which should be replaced by its logr counterpart.

| Function | Replacement | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ZarfCommand | Info | Just formats a slice as a command. |
| Command | Info | Outputs a command with a prefix and style. |
| Debug | Debug | |
| Debugf | Debug | |
| ErrorWebf | N/A | Not used anywhere. |
| Warn | Warn | |
| Warnf | Warn | |
| WarnErr | Warn | |
| WarnErrf | Warn | |
| Fatal | N/A | Should not be used. |
| Fatalf | N/A | Should not be used. |
| Info | Info | |
| Infof | Info | |
| Success | Info | Seems to be a info log with a checkmark prefix. |
| Successf | Info | Seems to be a info log with a checkmark prefix. |
| Question | ? | Open question how to resolve this. |
| Questionf | ? | Open question how to resolve this. |
| Note | Info | Should just be an info or maybe a debug log. |
| Notef | Info | Should just be an info or maybe a debug log. |
| Title | ? | Not sure how this should be replaced as it formats with separator. |
| HeaderInfof | ? | |
| HorizontalRule | ? | |
| JSONValue | N/A | Should be replaced with a marshal. |
| Paragraph | ? | |
| Paragraphn | ? | |
| PrintDiff | ? | |
| Table | ? | Need to come up with a good syntax for functions to return output that can print as a table. |
| ColorWrap | ? | Should this be used? | 
| PrintConnectStringTable | N/A | This logic should not exist in the message package. |
| PrintCredentialTable | N/A | This logic should not exist in the message package. |
| PrintComponentCredential | N/A | This logic should not exist in the message package. |
| PrintCredentialUpdates | N/A | This logic should not exist in the message package. |
| Spinner | Interface | New Spinner interface. |
| ProgressBar | Interface | New progress bar interface. |

The majority of simple logging changes should be possible with little signature changes. Replacing the existing output with a slog interface would allow other implementations to be used. A challenge initially may be the changes to table output formatting to make it work properly. This change will require some refactoring of existing code. A requirement for the changes is that they have to improve the UX for users looking at log files. As I understand the present day the spinners will cause a new line everytime they update, resulting in a lot of bloat. A goal should be to make sure that this does not happen in the future.

Spinners and progress bars however are a bit more challenging. They need to be refactored so that they are no longer instantiated outside of the CLI code. They should instead be passed as a function parameter to each function that needs them. A good example of a project that solves the problem in a similar manner is Kind. In Kind they create a [status object from the logger](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/blob/7799e72306db315ea4f4b1cac90ff68404da4f28/pkg/internal/cli/status.go#L39) which they then [pass to where it is needed](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/blob/7799e72306db315ea4f4b1cac90ff68404da4f28/pkg/cluster/internal/create/create.go#L133). Doing so results in a single status object created which is reused where ever it is needed. A lot of inspiration can be take from how Kind deals with CLI output. While they use klog instead of slog there are a lot of similarities. They have for example a check if the output is in a terminal or not, and will disable the spinner accordingly. 

Here is a suggestion for how a thread safe spinner could be implemented with a shared logger. This also allows for parallel spinners and progress bars.

```golang

	return &Spinner{
		sequence: []string{`  ? `, `  ? `, `  ? `, `  ? `, `  ? `, `  ? `, `  ? `, `  ? `, `  ? `, `  ? `},
		log:      log,
		printer:  h.printer,
	}
}

func (s *Spinner) Update(status string) {
	s.mx.Lock()
	defer s.mx.Unlock()

	// Do not update if status is the same.
	if s.status == status {
		return
	}
	if s.firstStatus == """" {
		s.firstStatus = status
	}
	s.status = status

	// If no printer we log normally.
	if s.printer == nil {
		s.log.Info(status)
		return
	}

	// Create or update the spinner.
	if s.spinner == nil {
		spinner, _ := pterm.DefaultSpinner.WithWriter(s.printer.NewWriter()).WithSequence(s.sequence...).Start(status)
		s.spinner = spinner
		return
	}
	s.spinner.UpdateText(status)
}

func (s *Spinner) Fail() {
	s.mx.Lock()
	defer s.mx.Lock()

	if s.printer == nil {
		return
	}
	s.spinner.Fail(s.firstStatus)
}

func (s *Spinner) Succeed() {
	s.mx.Lock()
	defer s.mx.Unlock()

	if s.printer == nil {
		return
	}
	s.spinner.Success(s.firstStatus)
}
```

The work will most likely have to be split into a couple of steps.

1. Remove any use of message fatal.
2. Refactor table printing functions.
3. Replace message logging with a structured logger.
4. Replace spinner and progress bars."
"## Context

Zarf currently does not have explicit schema versions. Any schema changes are embedded into Zarf and can change with new versions. There are several examples of deprecated keys throughout Zarf's lifespan such as:

- `setVariable` deprecated in favor of `setVariables`
- `scripts` deprecated in favor of `actions`
- `group` deprecated in favor of `flavor`, however these work functionally different and cannot be automatically migrated
- `cosignKeyPath` deprecated in favor of specifying the key path at create time

Zarf has not disabled any deprecated keys thus far. On create the user is always warned when using a deprecated field, however the field still exists in the schema and functions properly. Some of the deprecated keys can be migrated automatically as the old item is a subset or directly related to it's replacement. For example, setVariable is automatically migrated to a single item list of setVariables. This migration occurs on the zarf.yaml fed into the package during package create, however the original field is not deleted from the packaged zarf.yaml because the Zarf binary used in the airgap or delivery environment is not assumed to have the new schema fields that the deprecated key was migrated to.

The release of v1 will provide an opportunity to delete deprecated features that Zarf has warned will be dropped in v1.

Creating a v1 schema will allow Zarf to establish a contract with it's user base that features will be supported long term. When a feature is deprecated in the v1 schema, it will remain usable in the schema for the lifetime of v1.","## Decision 
## Decision

We will introduce an explicit schema versioning system with the release of Zarf v1. The initial schema version will be locked as `v1` and will establish a stable contract for users.

All previously deprecated keys (e.g., `setVariable`, `scripts`, `group`, `cosignKeyPath`) will be officially removed from the `v1` schema. While earlier versions of Zarf will continue to support these fields during migration and package creation, packages authored against the `v1` schema must use the new, supported fields (`setVariables`, `actions`, `flavor`, etc.).

A schema version field (`schemaVersion: v1`) will be added to the `zarf.yaml` to explicitly declare conformance. Zarf will validate this field at runtime and reject packages using outdated or unrecognized schema versions unless backward compatibility is explicitly enabled (e.g., via a flag in transitional releases).

This change ensures that:
- Breaking changes are clearly communicated and gated behind a version.
- Users can rely on long-term stability within the v1 schema lifecycle.
- Future deprecations will follow a predictable path: warn in one release, remove in the next major version.

Tooling will be provided to help users upgrade existing `zarf.yaml` files to the `v1` schema, including automated transformations where possible (e.g., `setVariable` → `setVariables`).","## Decision

Zarf will begin having proper schema versions. A top level key, `apiVersion`, will be introduced to allow users to specify the schema. At the release of v1 the only valid user input for `apiVersion` will be v1. Zarf will not allow users to build using the v0 schema. `zarf package create` will fail if the user has deprecated keys or if `apiVersion` is missing and the user will be instructed to run the new `zarf dev migrate-schema` command. `zarf dev migrate-schema` will automatically migrate deprecated fields in the users `zarf.yaml` where possible. It will also add the apiVersion key and set it to v1.

The existing go types which comprise the Zarf schema will be moved to types/alpha and will never change. An updated copy of these types without the deprecated fields will be created in a package types/v1 and any future schema changes will affect these objects. Internally, Zarf will introduce translation functions which will take the alpha schema and return the v1 schema. From that point on, all function signatures that have a struct that is included in the Zarf schema will change from `types.structName` to `v1.structName`.

All deprecated features will cause an error on create. Deprecated features with a direct migration path will still be deployed if the package was created with schema v1, as migrations will add the non deprecated fields. If a feature does not have a direct automatic migration path (cosignKeyPath & groups) the package will fail on deploy. This will happen until the alpha schema is entirely removed from Zarf, which will happen one year after v1 is released.

At create time Zarf will package both a `zarf.yaml` and a `zarfv1.yaml`. If a `zarfv1.yaml` exists Zarf will use that. If a `zarfv1.yaml` does not exist, then Zarf will know that the package was created prior to v1 and use the regular `zarf.yaml`. If the package is deployed with v0 it will read the `zarf.yaml` as normal even if the package has a `zarfv1.yaml`. This will make it simpler to drop deprecated items with migration paths from the v1 schema while remaining backwards compatible as those deprecated items will exist in the `zarf.yaml`

When Zarf introduces new keys that they are not ready to promise long term support for they will mark them as experimental in the schema. A key is assumed to be stable if it's not experimental or deprecated.

There are several other keys Zarf will deprecate which will have automated migrations to new fields
- `.metadata.aggregateChecksum` -> `.build.aggregateChecksum`
- `.components[x].required` -> `.components[x].optional`. Optional will default to false. This is a change in behavior as currently `required` defaults to true. However, automatic migration will work since we can set optional to true on any components which do not already have required.
- Metadata fields `image`, `source`, `documentation`, `url`, `authors`, `vendors` -> will become a map of `annotations`
- `noWait` -> `wait` which will default to true. This change will happen on both `.components.[x].manifests` and `components.[x].charts`
- `yolo` -> `airgap` which will default to true
- `.components.[x].actions.[default/onAny].maxRetries` -> `.components.[x].actions.[default/onAny].retries`
- `.components.[x].actions.[default/onAny].maxTotalSeconds` -> `.components.[x].actions.[default/onAny].timeout`, which must be in a [Go recognized duration string format](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
- charts will change to avoid [current confusion with keys](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/2245). Exactly one of the following fields will exist for each `components.[x].charts`.
```yaml
  helm:
    url: https://stefanprodan.github.io/podinfo
    RepoName: podinfo # replaces repoName since it's only applicable for helm repos

  git:

    path: charts/podinfo

  oci:
    url: oci://ghcr.io/stefanprodan/charts/podinfo

  local:
   path: chart
```
- A new field called `.components.[x].healthChecks` will be introduced and will utilize [kstatus](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cli-utils/blob/master/pkg/kstatus/README.md) to wait for resources to be ready after deployment. Read [#2718](https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/issues/2718) for more detail.
- a new field `.components.[x].wait` will be introduced. It will default to true, and automatically run `healthchecks` for every object in the cluster.
- `.components.[x].extensions` will be removed in favor of `zarf dev generate bigbang`. See #2875"
